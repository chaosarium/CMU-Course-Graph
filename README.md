# CMU Course Explorer

> Enlighten your path.

This repo presents the current state of team C.H.I.L.L Technology's TartanHacks 2023 Project. It's a graph-based course selection for CMU that visualizes the dependencies between courses. The tool also lets you save courses you have taken, courses you wish to explore or take and see them on the graph.

`frontend` directory is our web app
`backend` is not in use
`dataproc` is where we processed our data
