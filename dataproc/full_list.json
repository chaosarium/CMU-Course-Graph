The notion of a critical After-ness, i.e. Post-Modern, Post-Medium, Post-Internet was the desire for a serious recognition of multiple social and aesthetics definitions at the level of institutions (both inside and outside contemporary art).

While earlier approaches were based on classical artificial intelligence and optimization, recently, a variety of computational techniques from different fields, such as parametric modeling, agent-based modeling or neural networks, are incorporated in the development of new generative systems.  With recent developments in machine learning, we are reaching a point where we might not even have to explicit specify a new generative schema, but, instead, let it learn automatically from data or experience.    Contemporary design education must be reviewed with the possibility of relying on autonomous or collaborative design systems for the synthesis of alternatives. Designers should be able to formulate their design with different computational techniques, both with the GS available on commercial applications and with custom developed GS.

Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action.

James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving.

It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make this statement more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal influences may take place between the underlying hidden variables, and what we measure may be their reflections; so we will also see how to find the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations by analyzing measured variables. Its implication in unsupervised deep learning will be discussed. The other is how to properly make use of causal information.

The movements founder, C.S. Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was developed and popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.", "antireq": null, "min-grade": null, "prereq": null, "coreq": null}, "80-682": {"name": "Phonetics and Phonology II", "units": "12.0", "desc": "One of the central questions of research in human speech is how the patterning of speech sounds (phonology) relates to the articulatory, acoustics, and perceptual (phonetic) properties of speech; this problem is often referred to as the phonetics-phonology interface.

Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the causal view may facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning or artificial intelligence problems such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, disentanglement, and adversarial vulnerability.   This course is concerned with understanding causality, learning causality from observational data, and using causality to tackle a class of learning problems. We will particularly focus on two key problems in causality. One is causal discovery. It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make this statement more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal influences may take place between the underlying hidden variables, and what we measure may be their reflections; so we will also see how to find the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations by analyzing measured variables. Its implication in unsupervised deep learning will be discussed. The other is how to properly make use of causal information.

These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.  Each student will either build their own business concept,  or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business.

Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis.
