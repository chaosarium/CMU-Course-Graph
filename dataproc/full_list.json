In week 3, we survey the correlates of human rights abuses and review what progress has been made towards global forecast models of genocide, politicide, and mass killing. The core of the class in weeks 4-6 examines domestic and international forces and actors that attempt to promote human rights and assesses the efficacy of international NGOs and IGOs, international law, diplomacy and sanctions, and informal pressures of socialization and emulation The course concludes by reviewing current human rights challenges in the United States and future of human rights globally. By the end of this course, you should come away with an appreciation for the ongoing struggle to achieve the global aspirations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",

Students will choose a large dataset from a selection of biology, chemistry, math, or physics datasets hosted by PSC and use this dataset throughout the MS program. The topics of the course are taught with students analyzing the chosen dataset. An intensive knowledge of Python or another computing language is not a pre-prerequisite since students will be given at first simple scripts that they work with and then expand upon. This course is required for students enrolled in the MS program in Data Analytics for Science.",

Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models. Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.",

The combined impacts of technology and globalization have revolutionized the way we operate. Software is transforming the way companies innovate; how they interact with customers and ecosystem partners, the way they collaborate and communicate, how they access and distribute information, and how they co-ordinate and control. Traditional approaches that assume stability have given way to dynamic recipes.  The new imperative is to swiftly navigate changing realities. Flexibility, versatility and the capacity to quickly adapt to evolving situations have become the critical challenges. The course is based on the new edition of Prof. Evans book Super-Flexibility for Knowledge Enterprises (co-authored with Prof. Bahrami from Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley). Specifically, we will focus on the new rules of super-flexibility needed for continuous recalibration and adaptation. Priority registration for this course will be given to students in the Integrated Innovation Institute. (Note",

In keeping with Albers definition of color theory as a hands-on experiential and experimental process of creating relationships through perception students will work on skills needed to craft compelling images using linear, planar and volumetric assemblies in digital and analog media. Initial weekly exercises will cover principles of color relativity, intensity, temperature, etc., and consider various principles of graphic perception including but not limited to vibrating and vanishing boundaries, figure ground reversals, and the illusion of transparency. Through this process you will gain an understanding of the use of color in the graphic representation of designs, patterns, diagrams and architectural representations that will inform the use of color in transforming the perception of space. The final assignment will be a three-dimensional color structure.",

Reeling from the AIDS crisis, the continuing and rising conflicts of post-colonial struggles, as well as the growing sense of a radical call for the recognition of, to borrow from Fred Moten, an undercommons-the dematerialization of the object of Art was suddenly not sufficient as the leading critical, aesthetic discourse. The notion of a critical After-ness, i.e. Post-Modern, Post-Medium, Post-Internet was the desire for a serious recognition of multiple social and aesthetics definitions at the level of institutions (both inside and outside contemporary art). Critiques of the Subject, of Cartesianism, of Whiteness, of Patriarchy, of Cis-Genderism, of Binarism abounded and works of art like Andres Serranos Piss Christ (1987) or Chris Ofilis The Holy Virgin Mary (1996) were emblematic of the attack many artists staged on intolerance that gave rise to national and international political debates about the role of Art in culture and civic life. We are still feeling the effects of these struggles - this seminar will attempt to make sense of this history, examining what has come to be termed the Culture Wars, of the late 1980s and early 1990s in which issues that had been so hard-fought for in the sixties, i.e. womens rights over their own bodies, protection of the environment, issues of racism (recognition of difference), freedom of speech, separation of Church and State were under threat again. Specific excursions will be made into theories of abjection, intersectionality, precarity, relational aesthetics, and performativity. New media technologies, and especially the centrality of Social Media and Information Cultures, will be a special focus of the final weeks of the course.",

The applicability of such sensing technologies has been profoundly impacted by advancements in wireless communication and cloud computing, which have enabled the implementation of wireless sensing networks in structural, transportation, geotechnical, and environmental systems, to name a few. This course conveys recent advancements that have led to technologies from across engineering disciplines becoming increasingly relevant (and available) to our field, and emphasizes the critical role that civil and environmental engineers must play in leveraging our domain knowledge to augment these advances. As a result, this course studies sensors from a physics-based perspective in which the development and use of sensors stems directly from principles of mechanics (i.e., how physical processes can be measured and filtered using electrical analog signals and then converted to digital information for interpretation), and builds upon this perspective to provide a better understanding of the upstream tasks of a sensing system (e.g., data interpretation and management). This course will cover the practical and theoretical knowledge of sensor technologies for implementation in civil and environmental infrastructure systems. This includes the fundamentals of measurement and instrumentation theory, fabrication, operation, and deployment of capacitive, resistive, inductive, piezoelectric, and microelectromechanical systems. The course also covers DC and AC circuit analysis, signal amplification, interface circuits, filter design, frequency analysis, and analog-to-digital converter architectures. This physics-based perspective on the topic prepares students to extrapolate beyond the sensors to interpret data.",

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Should we expect them to do so? How are these two historical forms related? How can they complement each other?

The traces of classical antiquity, buried in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern landscape, retained part of their cultural significance over the centuries and became the object of a rediscovery, almost a cultural obsession. Artists, travelers and architects filtered and re-interpreted the reality of ancient objects and places, conjuring up their own vision of the past and nourishing their own creative pursuits from a continuous dialogue with history. At the same time, new political agendas, new biases and new goals were associated with antiquity, influencing the way the past of the region was explored, how the finds were studied and exhibited in residences and Museums, and ultimately creating a stern competition to appropriate this legacy, with deep links to colonialism and imperialism. The ripple effects are still being felt today, for example in the discussion about the repatriation of cultural heritage.  We will study the history of this moment to better understand the cultural vantage point that often influenced the fabric of our cities, presided over the creation of many of our cultural institutions and the buildings that represent them, and had a deep and lasting impact on the ideas about architecture and its relationship with history. This will help us grasp more clearly the impact of the passage to the Modern and some of the complex and still open issues it brought about.",

The course begins with a review of basic concepts in quantum physics (wave-particle duality, Schrdingers equation, particle-in-a-box, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then continues with a discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and  bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation and an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in nanoscience and   nanotechnology.

This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. Beginning with several works about regional/Islamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion. With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements. Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage. For each of these controversies, we will be reading a range of positions represented in different types of writing across genre, including scholarly writing, legal cases, media debates, films and literature.",

Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a birds eye view of their potential application in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer-aided textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences.

Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection. Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions.

Decoding is the term Im using to help you keep control of your process and create meaningful (not just dazzling) imagery for the stage. The entire theatrical process can be considered as a series of decodings and re-encodings, first decoding the text/idea (by the creative team), re-encoding (the design) and finally decoding by the audience.    This class is designed to give students a solid foundation in contemporary media design skills while simultaneously providing an examination of the function of theater historically and the ways media technologies fill those needs today. Early assignments focus on students use of media in their everyday lives, by keeping media journals and bringing in media objects for examination. Later classes focus on taking ideas from this research and applying them in conceptual stage designs for an ancient Greek play and then a controversial adaptation from the 1990s by Sara Kane.    Students learn how to go from textual analysis to a visual interpretation and staging with media. The class takes students through the process of initial creative brainstorming, to communication tools (concept sketches, digital renderings, 3D models), onto specifying a design through CAD documentation, projection optics calculations and final design presentations.",

        "desc": "Rather than working directly with analogue media, such as drawings, designers can develop algorithms and computational models that can automatically generate design alternatives, based on custom inputs. We refer to such algorithms and models as Generative Systems (GS).   GS have been an important topic of research in the recent past decades, in books, courses, articles and research conferences in computer-aided architectural design.  While earlier approaches were based on classical artificial intelligence and optimization, recently, a variety of computational techniques from different fields, such as parametric modeling, agent-based modeling or neural networks, are incorporated in the development of new generative systems.  With recent developments in machine learning, we are reaching a point where we might not even have to explicit specify a new generative schema, but, instead, let it learn automatically from data or experience.    Contemporary design education must be reviewed with the possibility of relying on autonomous or collaborative design systems for the synthesis of alternatives. Designers should be able to formulate their design with different computational techniques, both with the GS available on commercial applications and with custom developed GS.  The main goal of the course is to foster the students capacity to formulate design problems computationally, with emphasis on the synthesis of design alternatives. This course provides an overview of the main topics in GS, with historical notes and technical specifications. Along the semester, the students will address different design problems with different generative techniques. The course will address topics such as variational modeling, rule-based modeling, agent-based modeling, optimization and learning. The appropriate data-structures, algorithms and models will be discussed and some implemented in the exercises and projects.",

Electronic media does not change this focus, but our ability to foster this interaction with technology has been dramatically increased. The Internet provides new forms of communications like web sites, e-mail, social media, and mobile communications. However, these technologies do not necessarily replace traditional marketing vehicles like mass media, direct mail, and telephone marketing, but instead augment them to improve the customer experience. The basic premise of this course is that these technologies can be used to fulfill the goal of a customer-centered marketing strategy.  This course advocates an interactive marketing strategy as a framework for how to go about marketing to consumers with electronic tools. Interactive marketing evolves this strategy further by focusing not just on the companys interaction with the customer (e.g. advertising and direct communications) but the customers interaction with the company. This interaction has been enabled by electronic technology, such as the Internet, World Wide Web, E-mail, Instant Messaging, Search, and Social Media. The basic premise of the course is that these technologies (of which the Internet is the most prevalent) are bringing about radical changes in how markets work. These changes are brought about by cheap and powerful computing available to all members of the marketplace",

Throughout the course, we will explore the interactions of current theory and practice in medical communication and the role of writing in the transfer and adoption of new therapies and promising medical research. We will also study how the web and social media alter the way information is constructed, distributed, and consumed. We will examine the ways medical issues can be presented in communication genres (including entertainment genres) and discuss how communication skills and perceptions about audience can influence clinical research and patient care. Additionally, we will explore clinical trials, grant writing, and press releases, and will feature guest speakers from these fields will discuss their experiences.",

Students become immersed in pragmatic yet mind-expanding examples of person-machine interactions -- such as MEMEX, Musicolour, Hypertext, Dynabook, Fun Palace, Colloquy of Mobiles, Architecture Machine, THOUGHTSTICKER, Architrainer, and Hypercard. Through period articles and subsequent perspectives, students research a handful of historical innovationsand then prototype key concepts from that history, forefronting what has been lost in modern commercial implementations. This offers students a hands-on experience of the history of IxD. To explore IxDs future, students are invited to invent it -- to prototype their individual future vision of interactive experiences. The course is especially suitable for students with interest or background in interaction design, computational design, responsive architecture, and interactive media.",

In fact, Chinas last emperors were actually Manchus from northeast Asia. Secondly we investigate the social, economic, intellectual and demographic developments that transformed late-imperial China prior to the coming of the West. Thirdly, we examine Qing responses to a string of nineteenth-century disruptions, including but not limited to western imperialism, that threatened to not only end the dynasty but also challenged the very tenants of Chinese civilization. Lastly, we will look at the fall of Chinas imperial system, the end of empire, and the post-imperial struggle to reformulate the state and re-imagine society for the twentieth century.",

Critical reading and writing mean gathering and evaluating language and images to form an interpretation of a print, visual, or other media text. To that end, you will learn analytical keywords and terms from literary and cultural theory and how to apply them to texts and other objects. The focus will be on theories of race and gender and how they inform literary texts and our reading of them. Our courses method for critical writing instruction will be to workshop drafts of your essays. To that end, you will write four short interpretive papers in the course. You will also gain practice at oral presentation, peer-review and critique. To help us fine tune and integrate our critical skills we will spend the semester writing and thinking though genre, the categories by which we name and understand literature, and other media. Since this is a writing workshop and our time for reading will be somewhat limited, we are focusing on the gothic and its literary legacies from the 18th into the 21th century. The communication and analytic skills you acquire in this class will transfer to your work in a wide range of academic disciplines and professional contexts.",

Mentors may be graduate students or advanced undergraduate students carrying out research. At the beginning of each mini, the students and mentors will identify blocks of time each week for shadowing based on their schedules. If scheduling allows, students will also be encouraged to attend group meetings (this would count toward lab time). Shadowing will continue for seven weeks, at which time the students may rotate to a second group for another shadowing experience.

The main focus of the course is on applications of machine learning, but also covering optimization techniques. Students will learn (1) how to solve SE problems through a data-driven approach, and (2) how to bootstrap SE principles to implement and evaluate data-driven applications. Applications include generation of requirement specifications, automatic code documentation; software project cost estimation; software quality prediction; semi-automatic refactoring; requirements and defect prioritization, automatic bug assignment and test cases generation. A variety of data science techniques will be used, including deep learning, supervised and semi-supervised learning, search-based methods, and topic modeling.  At the end of the course, students are expected to (i) identify SE problems that can be addressed by data science techniques; (ii) identify the sources and nature of the data needed to solve these problems; (iii) choose the proper combinations of data science techniques to solve them; (iv) design, implement, and test data science applications using sound SE principles.",

For this, they rely heavily on their development team to architect and design products that are reliable, scalable, flexible, cost-effective and future-proof. They are surprised when the product fails to met these expectations - discovered only when the rubber meets the road - often too late to make any fundamental changes. These failures may manifest themselves in the inability of a product to scale the next million users, to integrate with other software systems, to support an international user base, or to enable sales through channels. This course aims to get product managers technically savvy about the non-functional aspects of a software system, and enable them to be influential in the architecture and design phase of product development. It will review a variety of architectures archetypes and analyze them for relevance to specific business requirements. It will also review some well-known products and explore their architectural characteristics. Students will architect and implement a software product using the principles learned in the course. Most coding will be done in Python, JavaScript and HTML.

In the current political environment, leaders on both the American political left (like Senator Bernie Sanders) and the political right (like Donald Trump), have called into question this bipartisan consensus in favor of freer trade and investment.  That turn away from globalization has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Was the earlier pro-globalization consensus wrong?  Is globalization good or bad for the U.S. economy?  What are the impacts of globalization on the rest of the world?   How has economic globalization impacted the environment and income inequality in the U.S. and around the world?  How should the Biden Administration seek to manage international economic policy?  This course provides future policy makers and managers with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to understand economic globalization and its effects. These issues will be studied using the analytical tools and concepts of international economics.  Guest lectures and case studies will provide a range of perspectives on current policy debates. The course will also examine science-based policies that could maximize the benefits and minimize the disruption generated by globalization. The fall 2021 version of the course will examine the global macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which international policy coordination -- or lack thereof -- worsened that impact.

Why do YouTube mega-influencers with tens of millions of subscribers exist, yet we have not heard of most of them? Why do echo chambers form and polarization deepen in social media platforms despite the utopian promise of the free flow of information and fluid connectivity between people that these platforms had envisioned? How do professionals land their dream jobs? How does mass adoption of technological innovations happen (e.g., Python, Bitcoin)? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of social connections that people form on and offline.   This course offers an introduction to the study of social networks as a powerful tool for understanding a wide range of questions and for solving real-world problems arising at the intersection of human social behavior and technological systems. The course first introduces network concepts and their mathematical operationalizations that give social network analysis the versatility for rigorous quantitative analysis. Students will subsequently learn how these building blocks have been applied to analyze and solve a wide range of online social phenomena. Finally, the course will introduce statistical models of networks that enable principled investigation of network formation mechanisms.   Throughout this course, students will work towards a final team project that applies network concepts and measures to either (a) describe and/or explain an empirically puzzling social phenomenon with network data, (b) develop a network data collection pipeline that aims to solve a real-world problem, or (c) build a system utiziling the insights from the course that solves a real-world problem. The following class activities throughout the course are intended to support and augment the final project.",

This course is designed for students with no, or very little, coding experience. So, if you have already taken a programming course, this course is most likely not for you. Students who have taken 15-110 and/or 15-112 may not take this course. For the final project, you will develop a small research project involving a computational analysis of a corpus of texts. You will plan, design, and write a computer program that processes and analyzes a textual corpus of your choice.    Students who are taking the course for 9-unit will write a brief project report (3-5 pages) that summarizes your final project. Graduate students in the MA in Rhetoric/PhD programs must register for 12-unit, and will complete a research paper (4,000-5,000 word).",

The ensemble has a strong emphasis on electro-acoustic performance technique, experimental approaches to staging and amplification, and visuals (live video, computer controlled lighting, wearable technology, etc.).   The group will perform works by new/experimental/electro-acoustic composers and will create new arrangements of works for which scores may not currently exist - for example, music by rock bands, electronic musicians, and sound artists.   The overall goal of the ensemble is to explode the idea of traditional concert music performance.  In so doing we shall advance student skills in music performance, music appreciation, and to advance the very important conversation on the future of concert music.  Students interested in this course who have not had the prerequisite should contact the instructors.",

In other words, by understanding the budget process, you be able to build better programs, manage projects, work with your organization to find resources. In order to bring you to that point, we will learn about how the budget process works, and how an organization obtains and spends money.

Can we know that there is an infinite being behind mundane reality?  What can we comprehend about such a being?  Is morality prior to or subject to that beings will?  Can such a being be innocent of our wrong-doing?   If there is such a being, are we responsible for anything?    All of those questions depend as much on what we mean by possibility, freedom and responsibility as they do on the truth of religion.  In this class, we fearlessly confront those questions and, in the Carnegie Mellon spirit, we relate each philosophical reading to relevant issues in science and logic.   Since the philosophy of religion literature focuses primarily on a Judeo-Christian context, the class begins with a short survey of the religious contexts of ancient Greece, Hinduism, and Budhism to provide points of reference from which to question Judeo-Christian presuppositions.",

We begin with isolating the basic phenomenon, delve into the conceptual and philosophical background dividing access from phenomenal consciousness, and discuss methods for tracking consciousness. We will then identify two clear questions about generic and specific consciousness. On generic consciousness, we shall explore a set of empirical theories of consciousness and the evidence that supports them. This will include recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, and higher-order theory among others. On specific consciousness, we will look at neural correlates and experimental interventions to test causal claims about how consciousness arises from the brain, with specific emphasis on sensory consciousness and the role of information and representation. Special topics will likely include the attention in consciousness, consciousness and agency, vegetative state, unconscious sensory processing in normal and lesioned brains, split brain phenomena and abnormal consciousness in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. If possible, we will have a few guest lectures by local experts.",

        "desc": "In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning, philosophy, and statistics for tackling long-standing causality problems, including how to discover causal knowledge from observational data, known as causal discovery, and how to infer the effect of interventions. A number of researchers have been recognized with the Turing Award (to Pearl in 2012) the Nobel Prize (to Granger in 2003 and to Sims in 2011). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the causal view may facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning or artificial intelligence problems such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, disentanglement, and adversarial vulnerability.   This course is concerned with understanding causality, learning causality from observational data, and using causality to tackle a class of learning problems. We will particularly focus on two key problems in causality. One is causal discovery. It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make this statement more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal influences may take place between the underlying hidden variables, and what we measure may be their reflections; so we will also see how to find the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations by analyzing measured variables. Its implication in unsupervised deep learning will be discussed. The other is how to properly make use of causal information. This includes identification of causal effects, counterfactual reasoning, improving machine learning in light of causal knowledge, and forecasting in complex environments, and we will investigate how the causal perspective helps in domain adaptation, image-to-image translation, and deep reinforcement learning.",

Consequently, there is a strong need for individuals that understand the complex ways in which these innovations affect marketplaces over time.

We depart from the fundamental ideas of monopoly and competitive pricing and study markets in which consumers interact across social networks and firms offer products to several markets simultaneously. The former enables direct network effects, while the latter enables indirect network effects. Lectures cover the fundamental concepts of economics and management applied to technology-enabled markets, including diffusion and critical mass, network effects, multi-sided platforms, pricing strategies, winner-takes-all markets, versioning, bundling, and envelopment attacks. We study these concepts in theory and lively with in-class discussions, competitive games, and simulations. We analyze several markets to complement the theories and models discussed in class, such as content distribution networks, social networking, the sharing economy, and online marketplaces for both digital and physical products. Students learn how to manage disruptive technologies and are exposed to frameworks and tools to characterize their dynamics over time.",

We will explore the fundamentals of service design in this lecture/studio class. In the first part of the class, well begin with a set of modules on tools and practices of service design. Then, youll put them to use in a group project, in which you design and prototype a service. Our goals (and the objectives of this class) will be to learn service design fundamentals by hypothesizing, experimenting, building, testing our assumptions, sometimes failing, tweaking, and improving.

Machine learning concerns the automated generation of knowledge.  Database theory concerns the maintenance of knowledge.  But  then what are knowledge, justified belief, truth, and evidence, and how do all of those concepts fit together?   The branch of philosophy that studies those questions is called epistemology, which just means study of knowledge.   This class confronts the central epistemological questions.  Topics include the analysis of knowledge and justification (what are they?), skepticism (the justifiability of beliefs that goes beyond the data available), and the relationship between knowledge and deductive logic (are the consequences of knowledge knowable?).  The proposed answers involve a subtle interplay of logic, probability, causation, and counterfactual reasoning.  The course is self-contained, so there are no prerequisites.",

The course also introduces students to the history of science as a standalone discipline, and in particular to the similarities and differences with other objects of historical inquiry (art, politics, etc.).",

Producing unique forms of play, and exploring themes outside the realms of fantasy, indie games are bigger than ever.    This studio course aims to introduce students to the history and methods of creating independent analog roleplaying games in their many forms. Students will receive hands-on experience which aims to cultivate a praxis and practice as well as investigate the current art of independent roleplaying games. Focusing on analog roleplaying games across the current indie design spectrum (storytelling, tabletop, journaling, and larp), students will split their time between playing games and critically learning from their form and creating their own games. At the end of the semester, students will submit their work in the form of a self-published roleplaying zine. There will be opportunities for students to receive feedback from current industry practitioners in critique sessions. No game writing or design experience is necessary to join this course.",

Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue.  The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them. For their final projects, students will have the choice to use modern sensors provided by the instructors (lightfield cameras, time-of-flight cameras, depth sensors, structured light systems, etc.).",

In this course we study the lingusitics of words and word formation, known as morphology.  We begin by asking what a word is, about the internal structure of words, and how new words are formed.  Throughout, we will consider these questions from a cross-linguistic perspective, looking at morphological data from a wide range of languages.  We will also consider how morphology interacts with other subfields of linguistics, including phonology, syntax and semantics.  Finally, we will survey morphological questions from the perspectives of language acquisition, psychology, and cognitive science.",

The measurement of neural activity involves a number of basic tools that have evolved over decades to sense the activity of neurons (individual neurons, populations of neurons and nerve fibers) or activity that is related to neurons (such as the oxygenation of blood in the brain). To intervene in the nervous system, a comparable set of tools have evolved to change neural activity locally or globally, on short and long time scales. The successful application of these methods to measure and manipulate neural activity requires both a basic science and engineering understanding of the principles behind their action, along with practical experience in applying them in real-world settings. This laboratory course will pair lectures with laboratory exercises to gain a deep understanding of the tools we use to measure and manipulate neural activity, as well as the analytic approaches to this data. It will involve both building and diagnosing recording hardware, experimental data collection, data analysis in Matlab or Python, and scientific writing. Overall, the goal is to provide students with a deep understanding of the methods for acquiring experimental data in neuroscience. Familiarity with signal processing and introductory Matlab or Python programming is helpful. This course is suitable for students from diverse backgrounds",

In addition, we are seeing a dramatic shift from a concentration on products and services driven through sales to focusing on customer experience and engagement.  Historically, marketing decisions were based on intuition, anecdotal information, company capacity and what has worked in the past.  John Wanamaker, a successful United States merchant who opened one of the first and most successful department stores in the United States, which grew to 16 stores and eventually became part of Macys, coined the term - Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I dont know which half. Dramatic shifts in the marketspace have resulted in changes in consumption, shocks to the supply chain and changes in how organization engage and interact with consumers.  In addition, disruption patterns result in fragmentation threatening market share especially for incumbents. Marketing is increasingly being called on to assess organizational strategies to deal with these shifts.  With an increasingly digitized society, data has allowed marketers to assess different channels for interaction, monitor the customer journey and measure interaction, brand awareness and consumer sentiment.  Marketers are looking to develop individualized consumer experiences which is predicated on data as well as revising processes and interaction across the extended enterprise.  Anticipation, resiliency and adaption to these evolving industry dynamics, shocks to the system and changing consumer expectations, is key for staying relevant and being able to take advantages of opportunities as they present themselves.

These sensors are also now pervasive across a wide variety of industries, from industrial settings, to manufacturing, to healthcare, to smart buildings. When coupled with the rapid advances in Machine Learning, IoT is expected to have huge potential to thus change, and advance society. In this advanced seminar course we will read about recent work in this rapidly evolving space of IoT and Sensing Systems. The list of papers will be solicited from the top recent conferences. Students will be expected to submit their summaries of these papers and lead a few paper discussions and participate in class discussions.",

We will explore key concepts such as relevance, equivalence, back-translation, and translation as a social transaction, and engage in the practical application of theoretical approaches to a variety text types with different purposes and for different audiences. In applied translation, the translators task is a process that can be defined as repurposing a text in another language for a functional use. Foremost in this process is preserving the integrity of the information being communicated, the appropriate context for the task. Students will further develop and refine their practical translation skills and apply them to examples from specialized domains such as health care, public affairs, business, marketing, journalism, mass media, literature, and others. In addition, students will gain familiarity with textual conventions that govern source and target texts within these domains and deepen their understanding of both L1 and L2 as languages for special purposes. To achieve this, students will analyze texts for register, style, tone, and content to determine the most appropriate process to achieve the highest quality translation, and also explore and utilize translation resources available to them as well as create their own, domain-specific resource kits. All students will complete a semester-long series of graded L1 > L2 and L2 > L1 assignments. Additionally, when assignments involve translation of texts into English, students will also be working in collaboration with faculty members in those languages. Students will maintain a translation portfolio throughout the semester. In it they will archive all portfolio assignments (drafts and rewrites), document their progress through the course (regular assignments, remedial assignments, a log of projects, due dates, turn in dates, and grades, etc.).",

The modern film and literature have inherited unique premodern characteristics such as an open-ended plot without any closure, a non-linear as well as linear way of storytelling, and a preference of atmosphere and beauty over a structured plot. On the other hand, partly owing to the Western influences, they have seen innovations in the art of storytelling (e.g., contextualization of modern self in an open-ended story, filming techniques).   The course focuses on the artistic media (e.g., language, sound, color, film techniques) of each film and literary work and their interactions with the plot and the historical and social contexts of each work.  It also explores how the art of storytelling is in tandem with the vicissitudes of human condition as illustrated in Japans variety of films and literature in the twentieth and twenty-first century. Analyses of each storytelling not only reveal cultural dynamics behind Japanese modernity, but also invite students to find new insights into Japanese culture and their ways to perceive our globalized world.   What kind of cultural exchanges took place between modern Japan and the West? How are Japans traditional values transformed in the face of modern technicalization and industrialization, compared to the modernization of other countries? And, in turn, what kind of impact has modern Japanese culture had on todays world? Tackling these questions among others, the course also extends to such issues as the legacy of traditional Japanese culture, the modern Emperor system, the World War II experiences, emerging voices of minorities and the popular culture (e.g., anime and subculture).",

This design elective investigates why we throw away things that still work, and shows how we can design products and services that last.   This is a studio class, with a substantial theoretical thread woven through it. We will therefore spend about half our time on lectures, readings, and debates, and the other half on studio practice, project coaching tutorials, and group critique. The result, a seven-week journey toward an experience heavy, material light design sensibility. A vital and timely new design philosophy that reveals how meaning emerges from designed encounters between people and things, explores ways to increase the quality and longevity of our relationships with objects, and the systems behind them, and ultimately, demonstrates why design can -- and must -- lead the transition to a sustainable future.",

Students will further develop and refine their practical translation skills and apply them to examples from specialized domains such as health care, public affairs, business, marketing, journalism, mass media, literature, and others. In addition, students will gain familiarity with textual conventions that govern source and target texts within these domains and deepen their understanding of both L1 and L2 as languages for special purposes.   To achieve this, students will analyze texts for register, style, tone, and content to determine the most appropriate process to achieve the highest quality translation, and also explore and utilize translation resources available to them as well as create their own, domain-specific resource kits. All students will complete a semester-long series of graded L1 > L2 and L2 > L1 assignments.

Do financial grants cause students to do better in college? Does a new public policy cause an increase in voter turnout? When tackling these questions, we frequently come across the phrase correlation does not imply causation. If thats the case, then what does imply causation? In this course, we will discuss causal inference methods for measuring causal effects of different interventions (e.g., drug treatments, financial grants, and public policies). First, we will discuss how experiments---where interventions are randomized among subjects---can imply causation when an appropriate experimental design and statistical analysis is used. Then, we will discuss how observational studies---where interventions are not randomized---can also imply causation when approaches like propensity score methods, matching, and doubly robust estimation are employed. Finally, we will discuss instrumental variables and regression discontinuity designs---which are frequently used in medicine and public policy for establishing causal inferences. Throughout we will use R to conduct causal analyses. A working knowledge of regression is encouraged, but regression will also be discussed and taught during much of the course.",

This course will introduce students to the multiple approaches to researching the complex problem of health disparities in the United States with particular emphasis on perspectives from the social sciences and humanities. Specifically, students will examine how factors such as socioeconomic status, education, crime, housing, health care and food availability play important roles in the production of disparate health. Students will examine psychological factors that can create disparate health experiences and the impact of such disparities on psychological health. We will address health disparities at the individual and population levels, learning how disparate health experiences are historically and socially produced, and how such disparities produce negative physical and mental health outcomes for individuals and minoritized populations. At the end of the course, students will present a collaborative group project that examines a specific facet of US health disparities and offer a proposed solution. Using a multi- disciplinary perspective, we will challenge students to discover just how important seemly unimportant interpersonal and structural factors can be in explaining health disparities and how important it is for society to take measures to address these disparities.",

While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1) critiqued the discipline of rhetoric; 2) developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts; and 3) expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include (but are not limited to) canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics (Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster), influential theories on contemporary topics (Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome), and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists (Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai). Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric. Undergraduates students (both majors and non-majors) will have the opportunity to examine how gender intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives.

Students will conduct a series of short design research studies to define learning goals and develop supporting design concepts intended to improve learning outcomes for diverse participants in informal learning settings (e.g. museums, after-school programs, maker spaces or online). In concept development, we will look at how to position technology and question its role in the setting to engage and foster positive learning interactions and conversation. This semester we will be working with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History as our primary stakeholder. The course will culminate in a media-rich presentation of design concepts and a fielded prototype to a review panel and include a piloted evaluation plan describing how learning outcomes for the project would be assessed.

This sedulous process takes very closer to the materials where a designer/ maker can gather insights into material behavior (both mechanical and visual) and is better placed to alter the effects of architecture through its materials and generating processes. The same can be applied to chair making. The chair no longer remains a chair, as the making process makes it a ground of experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. The reaction with the matter is no more inert, as it tends to provide feedback to the maker while shaping it. This immersive process of learning by doing in entirety, aids students, in improvising their thought process, the judgment of material behavior, use of the right tool to save material, and developing novel ideas for production and assembly. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.",

This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies.",

        "desc": "Internet services companies such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Meta, have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance. These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways. They are data intensive rather than compute intensive. They are also cloud-native distributed systems that are often deployed as microservices and require integration with external systems via networked-based APIs.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high throughput, security, reliability and availability demands as well. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover design principles and strategies needed to design and implement data intensive scalable distributed systems. In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance. Given the nature of these systems, basic distributed systems concepts such as time, transparency, data consistency and synchronization are also important. These systems largely operate around the clock, have components running on different nodes and platforms, so the course also emphasizes deployability and operational concerns. The course includes a hands-on project where students get to create and discuss design alternatives, and implement the solutions in a public cloud environment. The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project. The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space. Class size will be limited.",

It is connected to sophisticated philosophical perspectives, say, in the work of Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, as well as in contemporary analytic philosophy; it is equally connected to fundamental views in the sciences, say, in the work of Ptolemy, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, as well as in contemporary cosmology. The common view that mathematics - if not directly static - is evolving in a linear fashion, does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual changes concerning the very nature and object of mathematics. We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect radical transformations of the subject. These revolutionary developments made it possible to view mathematical proofs as objects that are representable in suitable formal theories.  Together, the three mathematical revolutions provide the theoretical basis for the formal verification of mathematical proofs by computers. Part 1 of the seminar presents some contemporary formal verification projects. Parts 2 through 4 analyze the three mathematical revolutions that are are systematically connected; they come most distinctively to life in the work of Dedekind, Hilbert, and Turing. Part 2 appears under the heading Structural axiomatics, Part 3 is titled Formal theories, Part 4 deals with the topic of Computations. In Part 5 we shift back to contemporary work that involves the formal verification of mathematical proofs. This work is focused on natural formalization and aims for strategic, human-centered automated proof search. It can be viewed as building a theory of mathematical proofs and, at the same time, as constructing a cognitive model of mathematical reasoning.",

The agreement that transferred Hong Kong from British rule to PRC control in 1997 enshrined the idea of One Country, Two Systems, a guarantee that Hong Kongs political, legal, and economic systems would not be altered for fifty years. One Country, Two Systems has also been offered as a blueprint for reunifying Taiwan with Mainland China. However, in recent years publics in both Hong Kong and Taiwan not only increasingly resist political reunification with the PRC, but more and more identify themselves as citizens of either Hong Kong or Taiwan rather than members of a singular Chinese nation. This has led to mass protests in Hong Kong and calls for true independence in Taiwan. Other topics that may be discussed include subethnic identity and ethnic minorities in modern China and the Chinese diaspora.",

This is a rigorous graduate school introductory statistics and data analysis course, and students who take this course will be enabled to use (and further develop) statistical reasoning and methods in your other courses, your summer internship, your Systems Synthesis Project, and in your career. In todays information world, data are available everywhere and the role of statistics is rapidly increasing in public policy, health care, the arts, the entertainment industry, business, academia and many other parts of society.

Alternative theories of aggregate economic behavior are reviewed, and students will formulate, estimate statistically, and test alternative macro-economic models.   A novel feature of this one-semester course is the integration of macro-economic theory and policy, annual and quarterly macro-economic data, and the estimation of simplified and more complex statistical models of annual and quarterly macro-economic behavior.  Each student will be expected to implement the theory provided in lecture and the textbook through a series of empirical problem sets which involve the statistical estimation and interpretation of macro-economic behavioral equations and underlying parameters for the aggregate consumption, investment, the demand for cash functions, and labor and aggregate production functions.  Data from The Economic Report of the President, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Economic Analysis, the database available within FairModel, and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Board will be placed on Blackboard in a series of Excel spreadsheets. The last problem set, which requires the estimation and simulation of the US, Indian and Chinese (mainland) economies under varying fiscal and monetary policy environments will use FairModel for the US portion.

On specific consciousness, we will look at neural correlates and experimental interventions to test causal claims about how consciousness arises from the brain, with specific emphasis on sensory consciousness and the role of information and representation.

Students will be expected to combine an understanding of the basic laws of comfort and heat flow with the variables of local climate to create energy design guidelines for their own work.  The state of the art in building energy conservation and passive heating and cooling technologies will be presented, with take-home readings and assignments.   To stress the significance of architectural design decision-making on energy consumption and comfort, full design specifications and calculations will be completed for a residential-scale building.  Students will compile a professional energy consultants report, designing the most viable energy conservation retrofit measures for their client from siting, massing, organization, enclosure detailing, opening control, to passive system integration and management. An overview of world energy consumption in buildings and energy design standards will be challenged by lectures on building energy conservation successes, and emerging demands for a broader definition of sustainability.  The course will end with a focus on the design integration of natural conditioning systems and the potentially dynamic interface of mechanical systems in small- and large-scale buildings.",

This course introduces you to a set of principles  methods in survey design that are the based on the scholarship that informs best practices in the field. We will use the concept of total survey error to frame an understanding of the key issues in survey research, including sampling frames, survey statistics, modes of data collection, non-response, question structure, wording, context  other important features of survey administration  data collection. By developing your own survey, you will examine the major decisions faced by a professional who wants to design  administer high-quality surveys.

Why do YouTube mega-influencers with tens of millions of subscribers exist, yet we have not heard of most of them? Why do echo chambers form and polarization deepen in social media platforms despite the utopian promise of the free flow of information and fluid connectivity between people that these platforms had envisioned? How do professionals land their dream jobs? How does mass adoption of technological innovations happen (e.g., Python, Bitcoin)? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of social connections that people form on and offline.   This course offers an introduction to the study of social networks as a powerful tool for understanding a wide range of questions and for solving real-world problems arising at the intersection of human social behavior and technological systems. The course first introduces network concepts and their mathematical operationalizations that give social network analysis the versatility for rigorous quantitative analysis. Students will subsequently learn how these building blocks have been applied to analyze and solve a wide range of online social phenomena. Finally, the course will introduce statistical models of networks that enable principled investigation of network formation mechanisms.   Throughout this course, students will work towards a final team project that applies network concepts and measures to either (a) describe and/or explain an empirically puzzling social phenomenon with network data, (b) develop a network data collection pipeline that aims to solve a real-world problem, or (c) build a system utiziling the insights from the course that solves a real-world problem. The following class activities throughout the course are intended to support and augment the final project.",

        "desc": "We live in an increasingly interconnected world, one in which our everyday actions have repercussions across vast distances. To understand this ever-denser web of connections,  we must think beyond simplistic accounts of globalization as a uniformly positive, negative,  or homogenizing process. Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality,  environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and irredentist movements are just as much a part of the story as are technological innovation, digital communication, global supply chains, cultural exchange, the promotion of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values.  This course aims to equip you with an interdisciplinary toolkit for thinking critically about the many dimensions of globalization (economic, social, political, cultural) and for engaging thoughtfully with differing experiences of them. By examining how globalization connects and shapes the everyday lives of people around the world, including our own, we will establish a foundation both for your advanced coursework in Global Studies and for your lifelong education as a globally aware professional and citizen.",

The course provides an overview of the major areas of scientific psychology, exploring the models of our mind, brain, and behavior that explain wide areas of human (and non-human) functioning. Topics range from neuroscience and the biological basis of behavior, to memory and thought, to social interaction and psychological development over the lifespan, to abnormal psychology, psychopathology, and treatment. Tuesday and Thursday lectures provide a broad survey of topics and findings in psychology. In recitation sections students get hands on experiencing thinking about psychological science by designing and running psychological studies and discussing the real world implications of the concepts they have investigated.  While all sections will be completing the same activities, some of the sections are themed.  Themed sections will frame the discussion in the context of the theme, thus allowing students in those sections to better appreciate the links between the work being done in the class and the theme of that section.  However, the core material will be the same and all sections will prepare students equally well for exams and upper division courses.  General (unthemed) sections will sample across themes and topics, rather than being focused on a single theme.  At the end of this course, students will not only be more knowledgeable about psychology, but be able to apply their knowledge about psychology to be better thinkers, learners, and consumers of information in general.

It also demands that designers pay more attention to processes and organizations - their own as professional designers, but also those of their clients and stakeholders. And it requires that interaction designers have a better understanding of their profession within wider socio- economic transformations.

In our daily life and science, people often attempt to answer such causal questions for the purpose of understanding, proper manipulation of systems, and robust prediction under interventions. In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning, philosophy, statistics, and economics for tackling long-standing causality problems, and a number of researchers have been recognized with the Turing Award (to Pearl in 2012) the Nobel Prize (to Granger in 2003 and to Sims in 2011). This course is primarily concerned with historical and technical developments of modern causality research, focusing particularly on how to discover causality from observational data and how to infer the causal effect of one variable on another. Thinking more broadly, causal analysis is a particular branch of unsupervised multivariate analysis. Accordingly, this course also provides a big picture of the foundations of causation and unsupervised machine learning. We start with unsupervised learning and multivariate statistical analysis problems including factor analysis, principal component analysis, and independent component analysis, and formulate their assumptions, develop their solutions, and study their connections with causal analysis. Finally, we investigate how the causal perspective helps in solving advanced machine learning or artificial intelligence problems, including transfer learning, image-to-image translation, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised deep learning.",

Efficient use of renewable electric power resources is considered, with emphasis on distributed resources and managing variability and intermittency. The technical and economic aspects of electric power transmission, distribution and storage are also evaluated.  Management, regulation and operation of the grid are evaluated, including various SmartGrid and MicroGrid initiatives and technologies in the US and worldwide.",

There are many different types of addiction; this course will focus on molecular addictions, with an emphasis on those involving members of the opioid class of narcotics. The ongoing epidemic of opioid addiction, arising both from over-prescription of pain killers and recreational use of heroin, has been widely reported and continues to rise at alarming rates, ravaging our urban and rural communities. In this course, we will explore the complicated role of chemistry in this epidemic, including the good (elucidating mechanisms of action, developing clinically useful and safe opioids and non-opioids) and the bad (design and synthesis of increasingly addictive opioids). We will also discuss ethical questions faced by the pharmaceutical industry that develops, markets and sells these drugs, the medical community that prescribes them, the government agencies charged with regulating these activities and law enforcement agencies that attempt to stop the flow of drugs into and within the United States. The second half of the semester will focus on addiction to other drugs, including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, alcohol and nicotine. We will also discuss chemical approaches to treating addiction. Students who complete this course will emerge with a broad understanding and perspective on an issue that is of great scientific and societal importance.  The course will be organized in units that begin with a historical/societal big picture overview, followed by technical discussions of the underlying chemistry and biochemistry, concluding with consideration of the societal implications of addiction to each particular substance.",

Architectural detailing is often considered only a technical task, but in fact the detail holds the key to inspire, integrate and reinforce the architectural idea as well as the architects intellectual/ societal position. Many scholars, historians and academics have avoided the detail as a snapshot into the design methodology of architecture. This class is an attempt to do the opposite. The course will consist of a series of weekly lectures, readings, field trips and student developed graphic and physical representations that reveal how the role of detail has played an essential role in the history, evolution and development of the built environment.",

After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses.     Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked.  The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.  After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?).    In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing.  Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation).

Some critics have stated that television is going through a renewed golden age.  The explosion of U.S. scripted content has increased the appetite for original stories both domestically and internationally.  In addition, the expansion of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have further expanded the global content market. As U.S. networks and distributors seek content, more opportunities for new voices and new points of view are welcomed.  This introductory class will focus on the fundamentals of writing for television with an emphasis on pitching and writing a television pilot. In addition to covering style and format, emphasis will be given to story ideas, outlines, structure, and marketability.",

Some of these entrepreneurial skills can only be learned through starting and growing a business while others can be learned. This course attempts to bridge the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship. We introduce you to an essential skill of market discovery or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where? Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies role-playing and solving actual problems of local tech businesses. The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, which is why this course will use true-to-life scenarios as the anchor for the course. The class will be divided into 4 teams will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local) or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor or both",

The semester will be divided into two-week modules in which faculty in the Computational Design program participate as guests. In each module guests cover topics derived from their own research, including readings and a short team-based project expanding on the topic introduced. The class thus introduces different approaches to the research and practice of computation in the creative fields at Carnegie Mellon. Topics include paradigms such as shape grammars, tangible interaction, machine learning, rule-based systems, responsive environments, and architectural robotics, among others.

Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection.

Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kindsincluding politicians, journalists, and scientistsstrategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed. Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends. More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable. Ultimately, you can conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals.",

We will examine South Asian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. By the earliest Chinese dynastic period, urban planning and building placement were beginning to be codified according to Confucian and Daoist ideals. Later Chinese imperial centers were consciously designed according to Confucian regularity and hierarchy in order to make visual statements about power. We will then move to consider urban organization and Buddhist temples in China, Korea to Japan where South Asian and Eurasian models were adopted and adapted. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through individual and group projects that will investigate specific structures and situate the buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation.",

The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea. This course is NOT open to students outside of the MHCI program.",

Therefore we will first compare and contrast the ideas of various quality gurus, examining the different ways to define and measure quality. In most cases, the goal should be to design and maintain a process which is in statistical control, producing with the best nominal value, and with a minimum of variation. How to determine what is best is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider some of the issues surrounding successful adoption of quality improvement initiatives   finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs, including six sigma.    We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics   the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a focused discussion of specific six-sigma ideas and techniques, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be very comfortablewith its technical tools.    Other topics we will consider include process capability, setting tolerances, process control, quality in service operations, evaluatory techniques such as the House of Quality, and ISO 9000 certification.",

Since Darwins theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.",

Students will discuss neuro-ethical implications of neural technologies and learn about the process of bringing such technologies to market, including intellectual property and FDA approval considerations. Students will also discuss essential career development skills for a neuroengineering R  D career in academia and industry. Students will also have the opportunity to tour neuroengineering research and/or clinical laboratories. An important component of the course is to develop students communications skills including developing an effective research proposal and an effective technical report, as well as effective oral presentations of the ideas developed in the proposal and technical report. The essentials for successful proposal writing will be discussed in case studies. Each student will be required to develop a research proposal based upon students own research or an emerging research topic in neuroengineering. Each student will also be required to develop a technical report on an neuroengineering topic. It is expected that students will improve her/his writing skills for proposal/report development with case studies, group discussions, and individualized feedbacks on students own writing and presentation. This course will help students to develop practical skills addressing real world problems in neuroengineering.",

The class will start with meetings with CMoA curators, education staff, docents, and conservators to understand how the museum produces, rather than merely preserves culture, and then will move to the production of student-designed projects that engage directly with the museum and its publics. While nominally open to everyone, its important to recognize that museums are also delimited by boundaries that limit them to certain uses by certain publics. This class will look at how artists, curators and educators have been working to reimagine the social role, politics, and pedagogy of the museum, questioning the very notion of who a museum is for and what a museum could become in the future.

The second semester, taught by Jonathan Kline, supports students in rigorously exploring their hypothesis through design and writing. For their thesis projects students focus on an urban milieu of their choice, research its actors, explore its social and ecological issues, and ultimately posit a hypothesis about how urban design might support new forms of commoning. Design exploration is organized around applying patterns and systems of commoning identified in case studies to their chosen urban context to create and support new forms of community-led resource sharing.

These methods rely upon simulation techniques, particularly the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These new techniques have allowed applied researchers and practitioners to focus more on solving new problems instead of the methodology. This has opened up new areas applied research to Bayesian methods. The focus of this course is applications of Bayesian statistical analysis to one of these areas, Marketing.

Entrepreneurship is a key part of an economys search for new solutions that increase customer value. Why is it a search? Because, when the conditions surrounding a contemplated new product are uncertain, the answers to key questions are not known apriori. What features are actually needed? Does the product or service  in fact solve the problem we think it does for the users? Are they willing to pay enough for the product to make bringing it to market profitable? Ultimately, entrepreneurship is a critical part of the growth engine that improves a societys standard of living. In this course we look at how to facilitate this searching process and hopefully maximize the chance of bringing a successful new product to market.  Students learn to think more deeply about how markets operate, what creates value, and how to investigate an idea in an environment characterized by risk and the need to be profitable. In other words, they learn to think like an entrepreneur. They gain an appreciation for entrepreneurship as just one part, albeit an important one, of the entire economy. They hear first-hand from multiple entrepreneurs and learn about their personal experiences and lessons learned.",

This course will (b) discuss exemplary works in CSS that made novel discoveries or made theoretical and/or methodological breakthroughs and (c) cover practical considerations that commonly arise in a CSS research project cycle. These issues may include, but are not limited to, data collection (sampling methods and bias), repurposing existing datasets that were collected in a different research context, constructing metrics based on theoretical insights, analytic approaches adequate for a given research question (statistical modeling, network analysis, online experiments, simulation-based theory development), big data processing and analytic tools (distributed data processing frameworks, visualization), ethical considerations, and data sharing. In the end, this course will help participants develop good taste for theoretically insightful, methodologically creative, and well thought out research, while learning to identify potential pitfalls that could arise in their own research.",

The course includes an attendance requirement and active engagement in class discussion, assigned readings/videos/podcasts (2 hours/week), self-selected experiential opportunities (2 hours/week), reflective journaling (2 hours/week), three hour-long one",

        "desc": "Design often favors probability. Rather than just problem solving, design should exploit curiosity, creativity, and criticality. A venture into the what if is arguably more relevant and promising than an investigation of what should be.  Possibilistic Design is a project-based design seminar that concentrates on how critical design theory and powerful storytelling might pave the way for a more responsible, equitable, and exciting future. By investigating what speculative designers such as Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby call the possibilities of things, we will consider design as a tool to unearth how the world could be, or even how it couldve been.  Students will research multimedia sensing to conceptualize on alternative ways of observing, measuring, and quantifying the spaces around us. We will question why certain experiences make us feel a certain way, what role our senses play in perception, and how we can implement speculative design, conceptualism, and counterfactualism to powerfully reframe an experience. Several short projects will ask students to push the capacities of sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste, and other interstitial senses. The final term project will be to design, render, and prototype a large scale multisensory tool, wearable, or site-specific installation that augments the ambience of a space or experience.  While the course encourages students to engage with digital and physical fabrication, virtual interfacing, animation, electronic prototyping, and basic programming, such tools are not required. With the exception of a few workshops throughout the semester that will focus on such hard skills, class time will be primarily reserved for precedent study, reading discussion, and design critique.",

We will discuss the ways in which buildings of the past and the practice of architecture were affected by which materials were available, how they were produced, and the craft required to work them. We will reflect on how architects interpreted, manipulated, or added to those meanings through their own work. Materials lifecycles and the networks of extraction, production, transportation, and reuse had an impact on the built environment in the past, just as they do today. We will learn from historical examples to assess the consequences of the choices we make as designers. Finally, we will critically engage with the presence of history as a layer of complexity embedded in the material itself - an effect that is compounded in the practice of reuse of materials with patina, marked from their past use.",

Would it surprise you to know that despite numerous successful single-family projects, only a limited number of successful multistory, multifamily zero examples exist? Creating multifamily housing that reaches net zero or carbon neutral goals is challenging since occupant behavior can influence the outcome as much as building design and construction. Yet multifamily housing is an essential typology to address rapid development and urbanization. Take on the challenge of creating high performance housing for our net zero future by exploring the technical and social demands of multifamily zero energy design or renovation. 48-752 is a graduate level course designed to support that goal. Through lectures, outside research, discussion, and a final applied project, youll explore the design approaches, codes, policy, technology, and energy infrastructure options that can help you achieve the housing performance we know is essential for a sustainable future.",

This course, drawing on research across social science and history, answers these questions by analyzing the institutions, processes, and consequences of governments mechanisms of physical and social control. Among other topics, we will examine the origins of state coercion, the structure and organization of state coercion, and the cooperation of civilians and other social actors with coercion. Beyond physical-legal coercion, we will evaluate softer forms of social control such as propaganda, censorship social pressure, and 21st-century digital strategies of information manipulation. We will also consider the imprint of physical and social control on the populations beliefs and behavior, both during the time they are subjected to coercion and the period following its end.

More than a large model or mere three-dimensional rendering of form, the prototype is a testbed and instrument of design projection. The prototype brings with it the physical instantiation of design ideas at larger scale and in actual materials to provide the designer with the feedback of material qualities and performance.  The prototyping process is a potential vehicle for discovery in which affordances of fabrication processes and unanticipated results expand the realm of possibilities and challenge assumptions of linear design to fabrication processes. The course places great emphasis upon the reciprocity of design and prototyping, challenging students to leverage physical artifacts as tools for thinking. Prototyping is a means of exploration, not merely a method of production or fabrication.   Selecting an architectural condition from a previous design project, students utilize modeling, prototyping, and simulating to develop a detailed architectural element. Students produce a series of versions of their architectural element culminating in a final prototype and collection of digital representations.  The course is structured as two modules. Module 1 provides a historical and theoretical background of digital fabrication in architecture, while asking students to identify significant references related to their architectural element, its potential material makeup, construction system, and fabrication process(es).  Module 2 operates as a laboratory/workshop in which students produce a comprehensive collection of models, material tests, simulations and prototypes using both digital and analog methods of fabrication.",

For Fall 2021, the Policy Innovation Lab will be looking at ways to improve Public Interest Tech workforce development and recruitment, with a special lens towards diversity, equity and inclusion.    Students will be working with external partners to investigate real problem spaces and building policy-driven prototypes driven by user research. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. This course is designed to take advantage of recent lessons learned in applied innovation in government entities around the world. The actual outcomes will be heavily dependent on both the needs of the problem sets for each course as well as the skills of the students.  The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and prototyping to deliver open source products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course. For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to deliver for our government partners.",

Each writer works on a team to create an original RPG campaign-style adventure for that game and story world.

The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel -- extracted from the big plan-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.  These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.  Each student will either build their own business concept,  or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business.  Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.

These activities often occur within the so-called gray zone, an area of neither declared nor undeclared hostilities where U.S. adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and others are gradually allocating resources. This course will examine and historically contextualize various new trends in warfare, including operations in the information environment, the development of violent non-state actors with conventional military capabilities, and state support of mercenary forces to achieve strategic gains without attribution. Case studies examined in this course will include Russian mercenary activities across the Middle East and Africa, Chinese cyberwarfare and information operations, Iranian sponsorship of proxy militias in Syria and Lebanon, and a range of other emerging trends in areas such as technology, demographics, and social media, all of which are combining to characterize the way wars are fought today.",

Managers and members of organizations have different interests and resources. They are interdependent. When interdependent organizational actors with different interests need to attain certain goals, this can not be done without working with and through others. Consequently, leaders need to find ways to influence others to act in ways which they might not choose to do otherwise. We discuss how these political actions are associated with networking behaviors and how social relationships co-evolve power dynamics in organizations.

First and foremost, analog circuits act as the interface between digital systems and the real world. They act to amplify and filter analog signals, and to convert signals from analog to digital and back again. In addition, high performance digital cell design (either high speed or low power) also invokes significant analog circuit design issues. The goal of this course is to teach students some of the methods used in the design and analysis of analog integrated circuits, to illustrate how one approaches design problems in general, and to expose students to a broad cross-section of important analog circuit topologies. The course will focus on learning design through carrying out design projects. Design and implementation details of wide-band amplifiers, operational amplifiers, filters and basic data converters will be covered. Example topics to be covered include transistor large- and small-signal device models, small-signal characteristics of transistor-based amplifiers, large-signal amplifier characteristics and nonidealities, operational amplifier design, basic feedback amplifier stability analysis and compensation, and comparator design. The course will focus primarily on analog CMOS, but some aspects of BJT design will be discussed.  18-290 and 18-320 or equivalent background material with permission of the instructor.

One can relatively quickly pull images off the internet and project them huge onstage, but what does it mean?      Decoding is the term Im using to help you keep control of your process and create meaningful (not just dazzling) imagery for the stage. The entire theatrical process can be considered as a series of decodings and re-encodings, first decoding the text/idea (by the creative team), re-encoding (the design) and finally decoding by the audience.    This class is designed to give students a solid foundation in contemporary media design skills while simultaneously providing an examination of the function of theater historically and the ways media technologies fill those needs today. Early assignments focus on students use of media in their everyday lives, by keeping media journals and bringing in media objects for examination. Later classes focus on taking ideas from this research and applying them in conceptual stage designs for an ancient Greek play and then a controversial adaptation from the 1990s by Sara Kane.    Students learn how to go from textual analysis to a visual interpretation and staging with media. The class takes students through the process of initial creative brainstorming, to communication tools (concept sketches, digital renderings, 3D models), onto specifying a design through CAD documentation, projection optics calculations and final design presentations.",

The topics are intended to enable students to understand which materials are feasible for 3D printing. Accordingly, high power density welding methods such as electron beam and laser welding will be discussed, along with the characteristic defects. Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection. Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions. The impact of data science on this area offers many possibilities such as the automatic recognition of materials origin and history. Finally the context for the course will be discussed, i.e. the rapidly growing penetration of the technology and its anticipated impact on manufacturing.",

Topics include the analysis of knowledge and justification (what are they?), skepticism (the justifiability of beliefs that goes beyond the data available), and the relationship between knowledge and deductive logic (are the consequences of knowledge knowable?).

We will then identify two clear questions about generic and specific consciousness. On generic consciousness, we shall explore a set of empirical theories of consciousness and the evidence that supports them. This will include recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, and higher-order theory among others. On specific consciousness, we will look at neural correlates and experimental interventions to test causal claims about how consciousness arises from the brain, with specific emphasis on sensory consciousness and the role of information and representation. Special topics will likely include the attention in consciousness, consciousness and agency, vegetative state, unconscious sensory processing in normal and lesioned brains, split brain phenomena and abnormal consciousness in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the lambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. We shall see how this idea connects logic with topology (the models of a theory form a space).

How do we as a society respond to challenges and struggles that go beyond our daily work routine and encompass threats to our physical and mental health, social interactions, family life, and hobbies and leisure activities? Today, when the new normal seems to be lasting forever and we face an unprecedented mental health crisis, how can we address questions of resilience, wellbeing and perseverance in the classroom, both from an academic and a personal point of view? How can we rebuild communities and societies after traumatic and scarring events, communicate and collaborate across disciplines to solve complex problems, and establish a world where we thrive and succeed again? In a more fundamental way, what does it mean to be resilient, and where is the boundary between our own health and wellness and the cultural, societal, or economic expectations around these ideas?  To answer these questions, this course will use graphic novels from English-speaking, German-speaking, and Spanish-speaking countries as its core to introduce students to a variety of graphic approaches to the concept of resilience, including from the graphic medicine genre. We will explore mental and physical health and healing in innovative ways to analyze different perspectives on and models for wellbeing. Working comparatively across cultures, the graphic novels in the course will help re-examine and re-define our understanding of wellbeing and health and explore how visual storytelling can drive social change around issues of individual and community resilience.",

Cultural History of the Visual Arts -The Modern Period (offered in the spring) covers the period from the 1800s to the 2000s and features masterpieces and lesser-known works that define our idea of what art is and what role it has in society. Some of the topics we will study include the invention of a modern ways of seeing in Japanese art; the impact of science, film and photography on the Impressionists; the myth of the artist as a savage, a fool, and a prophet; the creation of ideal homes for common (and uncommon) people; the meaning of the avant-garde; and the many ways in which artists and politicians experiment with art and architecture in order to control our minds and emotions.

For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and in a compelling manner to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain science, medicine, or technology to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing or a computer programmer describing new software to a firms marketing staff. Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit. You will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles, and rewriting them after theyve been edited. Your assignments will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works. In particular, this years class will focus on how science and society interact, whether that means the way that science writers write about public health and the COVID pandemic or climate change. The class will be run partly as a writing workshop where students will be organized in teams where they will discuss ideas, as well as edit and critique each others work in class, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through.",

The decision to outsource software services to providers in distant places has many risks and thus careful management of critical success factors is essential.  Likewise, products and services are being developed and delivered by teams of people in diverse locations working together. Management of these sourcing models and human capital relationships will be an increasingly important skill for students expecting to fully participate in the emerging IS marketplace of the 21st century.  This course introduces the effective fundamentals of global project management and the mechanics of sourcing arrangements including offshore outsourcing.  Students will also examine the effects of human diversity and cross-cultural considerations in the creation, use and management of information systems.",

How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

By engaging in technology as a lens, this sequence of weekend micro-courses encourages students to examine technology as a system disproportionately impacting humanity by enabling and constraining human rights of groups of people around the globe. With a multi-disciplinary focus, the course invites researchers and practitioners from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and relevant fields more broadly.  In Fall 2022, the focus will be on humanitys use of technology and the disparate impacts on and benefits to the environment and varying groups of people. This will include discussion around the material, environmental, and health costs of extracting materials necessary to technology development and production as well as the waste created by the consumption habits initiated by global reliance on technology. It will also include a discussion of technologys role in advancing sustainability.  Added Note",

In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering.

How did they survive, adapt to, and resist the conquest and colonization of their lands, and ensuing social and cultural dislocations? How have they resurged politically, culturally, artistically and intellectually in recent years? This course considers the history, experiences, and perspectives of native populations across the Americas. It seeks to reckon with the facts of the Native American experience, while challenging the fictions of stereotypes and narratives that have often relegated Indigenous people to the social and cultural margins of the nations in which they now live. After introducing students to a few of the myriad Indigenous groups of North, Central and South America, we will then survey the implications of the era of European conquest and colonization. Well consider the implications of the rise of new nations in the Americas, as new and intensifying campaigns of violence were unleashed against Indigenous populations. We will consider the rise of Native American civil rights and political and cultural sovereignty movements from the late 20th century forward, as they coalesced into major political challenges to native marginalization and demands for recognition and reparation of historical injustices. Finally, we will explore how contemporary Indigenous artists, authors, and political and social activists are reimagining indigeneity (the condition and experience of being Indigenous) in ways that demonstrate how indigeneity is not a fixed kind of identity, not one that is confined or defined in any way by a static conception of tradition, but rather one that challenges the present and reimagines the future in dynamic and creative ways.",

Social scientists have found much material to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces -such as economic, social, and cultural- affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the regions present, it is necessary to study path dependence and learn how the worldviews of dominant elites evolved over time. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on most of the Cold War period (1947-1978) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last forty years, from the wave of transitions to democracy to current challenges to democratic consolidation. We will also address how Latin America has integrated to globalization and how the relationship with the US and China has experienced fundamental changes since the 1990s.",

Due to their small size scales, microrobots will encounter difficulties unlike their macro-scale counterparts, in terms of fabrication and autonomy. In this project-based course, our aim will be on learning the physics of scaling, fabrication paradigms, actuation and sensing strategies, with numerous case studies, and to build an insect-inspired robotic system.

In the beginning the arts were for entertainment and profit. Today, the need to entertain and pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences and serve their community via one or several intersecting art forms.  Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent.  Driving and complicating the situation is the common bifurcated management structure.  Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework that shapes an institution and its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical and financial situation of a company.  Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure.  Organizational history, indeed the history of the art form, provides a vexing structure and habit to the process that must be dismantled to meet the demands of a socially just, 21st century model.   If a career of doing the same thing is the goal, then a different field might be recommended.    This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure that meets the demands of a post-Covid, anti-racist reality.

Research on both help-seeking and help-provision will be covered, as well as the implications of this type of pro-social behavior for relationships and health.  The course also will cover research on other types of pro-social behavior such as empathy, altruism, forgiveness, and cooperation.      This is an advanced seminar in which you will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a topic of interest.",

Some have also coined this time as the second renaissance noting that this era is changing our core frameworks for civilization. As in the age of the renaissance, creativity and the arts are often at the cutting edge for creating and incorporating technologies in the world even though some nonprofit institutions seem slow to adapt.  This seminar course provides students with multiple perspectives on how emerging technologies are disrupting arts enterprises, including arts-making, audience engagement, and arts management. From the Internet of Things to Virtual Reality, students will investigate what is happening in the field and whats on the fringe and about to break into the marketplace. Through readings, hands-on activities, and individualized research the course provides a breadth of understanding of multiple technologies for students overall while each individual student pursues deeper expertise in one or two technologies of their choice.  The material submitted for assignments may be recommended to be included in the content created for AMT Lab (www.amt-lab.org) Readers for the platform are arts management professionals working in the field.  Approximately 3000 individuals from around the world read the content monthly.   The process for publication is provided on Canvas.",

This course bridges the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship. We introduce the essential skill of market discovery, or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product, or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where? Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies, role-playing, and solving actual problems of local tech businesses.  The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, so the course will use true-to-life scenarios. The class will be divided into teams and will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for a new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local), or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor, or both.",

Students are instructed in how to confidently and respectfully ask critical questions of those shaping policy.

Knowing how to direct a roundtable is a significant element in the professional development of anyone interested in taking part in the policy arena, and this course helps students hone this important skill.

Along the way we explore major movements of the Euro-American avant-garde and so-called heroes of modernism, but also diverse responses to modernity, including vernacular, popular, tropical, and even anti-architecture around the world. We will highlight the role of experimentation and provocation, but also of timeless ideals, local and indigenous traditions, and how they each intersect with the demands of function and technology as well as social and political imperatives.

However, this course is intended to be a skills course, designed not to teach students about specific historical periods, but rather to give students the tools they need to conduct their own critical explorations into the historical past.",

Health Care consumers now have more access to information - pharmaceutical companies are engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing, patients can look up quality outcomes for their provider, and medication instructional videos are now on YouTube.  This micro mini course will highlight the data sources and insights used by providers, payers and tech companies to understand and influence consumer behavior. Students will gain insight into the descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytic methodologies and explore specific use cases alongside industry experts. Topics will also include the social science of behavior change and privacy and ethical implications of collecting and utilizing health data.",

Offering almost instant resolution of a seemingly complete architectural proposal - the architectural image / sketch can be generated without any design process, prompted solely through natural language in reference to the vast digital archives. Language of architecture typically considers spatial development of architectural forms based on architectural types, elements, programs, and ideologies, while resourcing the historical knowledge of a precedent. However, here the use of architectural reference - especially in context of its ethical implication - might be obscured. This studio will ask how we can expand the design process using AI. What are the consequences of jumping from a narrative into the generation of an instant image, and how does this way of working change design intent, socio-ecological framework, ideological implications and a spatialization process of an architectural proposal. The ambition of this studio will be to examine architecture that inquires into embodied energy as a primary inspiration for formation of matter. The goal is to re-situate design within a hyper-local framework of material resources and life-cycle that positions architecture as a vehicle for ecological and communal restoration. Promoting a shift away from purely data driven rationales, the desire is to engage in the design framed by environmental ethics and sensory subjectivities as part of our collective aesthetic and ecological experience.",

[The other introductory course is Entrepreneurial Alternatives (45806)  this course targets entrepreneurial opportunities that include acquisition of businesses, family enterprises, franchises, social ventures and other means by which entrepreneurial principles may be applied].  Each of these two courses serves as a standalone as an introduction to entrepreneurship, and the courses also provide a background for those seeking an entrepreneurship concentration or an in-depth Track immersion.  45805 emphasizes developing an understanding of entrepreneurial thought, mindset, and action, and then progresses thru idea generation, and screening for patterns to predict success, and which underlie entrepreneurial decision making for enterprise creation and growth. The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates, captures, and delivers value to the market.  High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential, typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures). The course also incorporates some fundamental aspects of building a team and financing the opportunity, whether it is a technology-based, venture capital financed opportunity or other ventures more suitable for alternative financing vehicles.  These latter two topics are included in more detail in subsequent courses.",

Illustrative examples will be drawn from the area of semiconductor nanostructures, including their applications in novel and next-generation electronic, photonic, and sensing devices.  The course begins with a review of basic concepts in quantum physics (wave-particle duality, Schrdingers equation, particle-in-a-box, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then continues with a discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation and an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in nanoscience and   nanotechnology.

In fact, Chinas last emperors were actually Manchus from northeast Asia. Secondly we investigate the social, economic, intellectual and demographic developments that transformed late-imperial China prior to the coming of the West. Thirdly, we examine Qing responses to a string of nineteenth-century disruptions, including but not limited to western imperialism, that threatened to not only end the dynasty but also challenged the very tenants of Chinese civilization. Lastly, we will look at the fall of Chinas imperial system, the end of empire, and the post-imperial struggle to reformulate the state and re-imagine society for the twentieth century.",

Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.",

Students will uncover what may be brewing underneath the surface of a given context, such as the residual impact of historic events, changes to the topographical landscape of a neighborhood, connections between individual behavior change to the growth of niche cultures, sensorial shifts in the environment due to climate change, emerging instabilities in a system sparked by the implementation of an idea, amongst others. Students will use present-day contexts, such as neighborhoods or particular initiatives, as points of departure to answer the questionswhen an idea is implemented to effect change, what happens to its context? Students in this course will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of instigating change to inform their ethos and practice.",

Offering almost instant resolution of a seemingly complete architectural proposal - the architectural image / sketch can be generated without any design process, prompted solely through natural language in reference to the vast digital archives. Language of architecture typically considers spatial development of architectural forms based on architectural types, elements, programs, and ideologies, while resourcing the historical knowledge of a precedent. However, here the use of architectural reference - especially in context of its ethical implication - might be obscured. This studio will ask how we can expand the design process using AI. What are the consequences of jumping from a narrative into the generation of an instant image, and how does this way of working change design intent, socio-ecological framework, ideological implications and a spatialization process of an architectural proposal. The ambition of this studio will be to examine architecture that inquires into embodied energy as a primary inspiration for formation of matter. The goal is to re-situate design within a hyper-local framework of material resources and life-cycle that positions architecture as a vehicle for ecological and communal restoration. Promoting a shift away from purely data driven rationales, the desire is to engage in the design framed by environmental ethics and sensory subjectivities as part of our collective aesthetic and ecological experience.",

It combines analytic with experimental methods to investigate strategic interactions in bidding, buying, selling, designing trading mechanisms, consumption based portfolio analysis, investment dynamics, and governance. We begin with an explanation of trading in electronic limit order markets, an exchange mechanism that has been widely adopted in the financial sector, is paradigmatic of most markets, and holds great promise for efficiently regulating procurement practices and inventory control in micromarkets. To analyze optimal trading rules, we investigate the role of arbitrage in limit order markets, and then probe more deeply into auctions, which are essentially one sided limit order markets. We describe the main kinds of auctions, investigate optimal bidding behavior, and compare revenue outcomes from different auction formats. Individual valuations form the basis for bidding and trading, and in the third section of the course we investigate how those valuations are determined. We analyze how investment profiles are valued from their underlying dynamic choice profiles, we characterize attitudes towards risk, and we explain preferences for consumption at different points in time. Armed with estimates of risk tolerance and timing preferences for consumption over the life cycle, we derive optimal consumption smoothing, which determines investment and portfolio choices, and motivates the demand for mutual and pension funds, hedging practices, and more generally a financial retail sector. This leads us to our last topic, problems peculiar to large investors, whose decisions affect the affect of the operations of the firm. We focus on the goals of the board members, their willingness to deviate from expected value maximization, and the means to implement their goals through managerial compensation po",

One of those junctions is where Art and Machine Learning meet. Art in recent years has been moving forward along with the rise of new technologies and scientific discoveries. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most cutting edge advancements in Computer Science. The popularity and accessibility of frameworks such as Googles Deep Dream system, Pikazo the neural style transfer, Kulitta AI Music Generation Framework, Deep Minds WaveNet, Sonys Flow Machines, and recurrent neural network based language models brought great attention to the marriage of Art and ML methods. The number of ML applications that mimic famous artworks, e.g. The Next Rembrandt project, or even create original artworks such as the robot artist TAIDAs paintings, is rapidly growing. Increasing number of artists are also attempting to use ML methods in their artworks.    This course is project-based and aims to introduce the crossroad of Art and Machine Learning to the broad range of students including both Art and Computer Science majors. We will offer the knowledge of examples, technologies, and issues that connect Art and Machine Learning to the students. Students will study example codes and produce creative applications/artworks using ML methods. Students do not need to have pre-existing knowledge of Machine Learning or experience of Art practice. Students are required to have basic understanding of Python and be open-minded, for example, open to learn the necessary mathematical background and open to discussions on conceptual development and artistic value of their projects. Students should have a basic understanding of Python.",

A heavy emphasis will be placed on classic research on helping (which investigates how, when, and why we help strangers), as well as the wide body of literature on social support (which investigates how we help, and seek help from, those who are closer to us).  Research on both help-seeking and help-provision will be covered, as well as the implications of this type of pro-social behavior for relationships and health.  The course also will cover research on other types of pro-social behavior such as empathy, altruism, forgiveness, and cooperation.      This is an advanced seminar in which you will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a topic of interest. Graduate Students Only.",

At the same time, comparative genomics, bioinformatic and reverse genetic methods are transforming the way in which gene functions are investigated, while the development of powerful methods for precise modification of genomes is opening the way to cell- and gene-based therapies for disease. In parallel, the promise of precision or personalized medicine is predicated on advances in understanding of complex traits, genetic interactions and networks. These and other topics will be covered following a review of basic principles of gene structure and expression, the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics, and their underpinnings in cellular mechanisms for the replication, recombination and transmission of genetic material.

Our consumptive path through modern life leaves a wake of social and ecological destruction -- sneakers worn only once, forgotten smartphones languishing in drawers, and abandoned IoT devices promising solutions to problems that dont exist. By what perverse alchemy do our newest, coolest things so readily transform into meaningless junk? This design elective investigates why we throw away things that still work, and shows how we can design products and services that last. This is a studio class, with a substantial theoretical thread woven through it. We will therefore spend about half our time on lectures, readings, and debates, and the other half on studio practice, project coaching tutorials, and group critique. The result, a seven-week journey toward an experience heavy, material light design sensibility. A vital and timely new design philosophy that reveals how meaning emerges from designed encounters between people and things, explores ways to increase the quality and longevity of our relationships with objects, and the systems behind them, and ultimately, demonstrates why design can -- and must -- lead the transition to a sustainable future.

Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the latest effort by the international community to encourage and facilitate broad-based progress across multiple sectors in individual countries.  The SDGs reflect an optimists perspective regarding international development. Optimists highlight the tremendous progress in improving the quality of human life that has been made during the past 200 years, and in particular since the end of World War II. Building on this record, achieving the SDGs will mark a notable step forward in addressing the most serious inequities that exist across the globe, including extreme poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, and inadequate health care. SDGs aside, pessimists worry about the enormous challenges currently confronting the international community. They note that by 2050 global population will reach 9.6 billion people. To feed an increasingly affluent number of people, we will need 70 percent more food production and a doubling of available water and arable land, which will come at the expense of existing natural systems. The availability of these essential inputs is further complicated by the reality that the planet is undergoing vast biological and physical changes due to climate change and environmental degradation. Human communities are changing as well. More than 50 percent of the worlds population live in urban areas and 75 percent of the worlds largest cities will be found in the developing world over the next few decades. These mega-urban areas create their own challenges from the spread of pandemic diseases, to sanitation, to energy needs. Please see the Heinz College course catalog for the more",

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking",

It will scrutinize the most evocative form of policy - economic sanctions - in addition to broader frameworks of statecraft which utilize multilateral forums which are the carrots of international economic policy. It will also educate students on the state of the literature regarding sanctions efficacy, and understanding what features of the economy render target states most vulnerable to coercion. In this way we will contextualize claims that Russia sanction-proofed its economy prior to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and gain deeper insight into the unprecedented sanctions which have been imposed as a result.

Gameplay is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. In class we utilize two existing Intellectual Properties (The Lord of the Rings and Thedas, the world of EAs DragonAge role playing games). Students who desire admittance to this class must be intimately familiar with at least one of those two worlds to gain entry. We just do not have time to review those works once class starts. Each writer works on a team to create an original RPG campaign-style adventure for that game and story world. The final product is a portfolio-quality set of dramatic scenes, epic tabletop encounters, and character sketches. This is not an RPG design course, nor will how RPGs work will not be taught.  Any level of writing experience is welcome, BUT experience playing RPGs -- either tabletop or video game -- is a must. Experience as a GM for an RPG is a big plus, and applicants who possess such experience should be sure to let the instructor know in advance.",

For five weeks in the middle of the semester, students will immerse themselves in an extended role-playing exercise, The Struggle for Palestine, 1936, an elaborate simulation game linked to Barnard Colleges Reacting to the Past program. Students portraying British examiners, specific Arab and Zionist characters and journalists will recreate the activities of the 1936 Royal Commission that came to Palestine to investigate the causes of an Arab rebellion and Arab-Jewish strife. This historical reenactment experience constitutes an exciting pedagogical opportunity for delving deeper into the topic material than regular coursework allows. All the role-playing will take place during regular class time, but students should be aware that they will need to devote outside time for preparation and research. Outstanding attendance is also a requirement. Regular classroom activity resumes at the end of the five weeks.

More than a large model or mere three-dimensional rendering of form, the prototype is a testbed and instrument of design projection. The prototype brings with it the physical instantiation of design ideas at larger scale and in actual materials to provide the designer with the feedback of material qualities and performance.  The prototyping process is a potential vehicle for discovery in which affordances of fabrication processes and unanticipated results expand the realm of possibilities and challenge assumptions of linear design to fabrication processes. The course places great emphasis upon the reciprocity of design and prototyping, challenging students to leverage physical artifacts as tools for thinking. Prototyping is a means of exploration, not merely a method of production or fabrication.   Selecting an architectural condition from a previous design project, students utilize modeling, prototyping, and simulating to develop a detailed architectural element. Students produce a series of versions of their architectural element culminating in a final prototype and collection of digital representations.  The course is structured as two modules. Module 1 provides a historical and theoretical background of digital fabrication in architecture, while asking students to identify significant references related to their architectural element, its potential material makeup, construction system, and fabrication process(es).  Module 2 operates as a laboratory/workshop in which students produce a comprehensive collection of models, material tests, simulations and prototypes using both digital and analog methods of fabrication.",

We will review classical topics like Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltons Principle of Least Action, as well as modern computational methods like discrete mechanics and fast linear-time algorithms for dynamics simulation. A particular focus of the course will be rigorous treatments of 3D rotations and non-smooth contact interactions (impacts and friction) that are so prevalent in robotics applications. We will use numerous case studies to explore these topics, including quadrotors, fixed-wing aircraft, wheeled vehicles, quadrupeds, humanoids, and manipulators. Homework assignments will focus on practical implementation of algorithms and a course project will encourage students to apply simulation methods to their own research.",

So what does it take to get a service right? And how can our services best communicate and reflect their interactions with us when theyre integrating different streams of data? We will explore the fundamentals of service design in this lecture/studio class. In the first part of the class, well begin with a set of modules on tools and practices of service design. Then, youll put them to use in a group project, in which you design and prototype a service. Our goals (and the objectives of this class) will be to learn service design fundamentals by hypothesizing, experimenting, building, testing our assumptions, sometimes failing, tweaking, and improving. Some great visitors will join us too, in person and virtually, to provide real-world insights about service design.",

Such languages come with additional challenges beyond traditional compilation as taught in courses, including efficient representation of high-level language constructs and automatic memory management in the form of garbage collection. Together, the components of the virtual machine and services form what is known as a managed runtime system.  This course focuses on implementation techniques for managed runtime systems.

We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gamblers fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings.   We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance.  The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables).

The psychological theories underlying these behaviors will be examined as well as their impact on the lives of stigmatized individuals. Its goal is to examine a number of social differences and understand how prejudice can impact many areas of society. In addition to the traditional forms of prejudice based on such things as race, gender and age; other inequalities that result from less traditional groupings such as social class, appearance, and disability and will be explored.  Research on issues of social identity, intergroup relations and the reduction of prejudice will be examined through readings and class activities.",

        "desc": "The course examines wealth management over the life-cycle by individuals and families as well as the role of intermediaries. We begin by applying basic concepts and tools from finance (portfolio theory and equilibrium analysis). Lifetime portfolio choice in perfect markets provides a benchmark for evaluating how taxes alter traditional conclusions about savings and asset allocation. We address risk aversion and diversification as well as the ramifications of market efficiency, equilibrium analysis and the absence of arbitrage, along with the impact of labor income and concentrated family wealth. We highlight the role and significance of borrowing and effective use of mortgage finance. We examine the impact of taxes on after-tax returns and wealth, and the structure of tax clienteles on both holdings and returns. Effective tax management is crucial to obtaining favorable outcomes when capital gains taxes are triggered by sale. We examine harvesting vs. deferral of capital gains and losses, valuing locked-in positions, management of wash sales, portfolio rebalancing, and the composition of risky portfolios (such as concentrated portfolios) with capital gains taxes. We discuss and contrast various investing products, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and customized investment vehicles. The co-management of taxable and tax-deferred (retirement) funds, the use and investment of Roth and traditional tax-deferred funds, and within these accounts, target-date funds and retirement plan defaults, all play an important role in financial planning. We will explore charitable gifting (e.g., when and what to gift and the potential role of donor-advised funds and philanthropic funds) and estate planning strategies, including such issues as family businesses, asset titling, and the integration of estate and income taxes. We apply our framework to a range of concrete examples and illustrative cases.",

Teams have emerged as a favorite work arrangement for such ongoing activities as developing new products, providing professional services, and starting new businesses.  Temporary groups are frequently assembled for a multitude of purposes, such as making difficult decisions, solving cross-functional problems, generating ideas, or performing unique tasks.  Indeed, groups and teams can be found at every level of the organization, from production crews on the shop floor to top management teams in the executive suite.  Moreover, advances in communication technology have created the potential for people who are dispersed across the globe to collaborate virtually, creating many new opportunities and challenges for leaders of such teams.  Teams are not a panacea, however.  Even as they become a way of life in many organizations, widespread myths and misconceptions about teams often stand in the way of effective teamwork.  At their worst, teams sometimes create more problems than they solve.  The core content of the course is a series of team and group exercises, case analyses, and readings. The exercises are framed and analyzed in terms of readings, lecture, and in-depth class discussions.  Much of the learning that occurs in the course will involve exercises, simulations, and cases that draw on students current experiences in the class as well as their previous experiences in teams and organizations outside of this class.",

Reading discussions, site visits, and presentations from outside experts (CMU faculty, visiting artists) will expose a range of relevant topics, disciplinary and creative perspectives, and potential avenues for investigation. Specific areas of focus will include Pittsburgh history, local ecological dynamics, labor history and the effects of technology on the landscape and lives of Pittsburghs population.",

These laws are applied to deduce relationships among heat capacities and other measureable quantities and then are generalized to open systems and their various auxiliary thermodynamic potentials; transformations between potentials are developed. Criteria for equilibrium of multicomponent systems are developed and applied to phase transformations and chemical reactions. Models of solutions are obtained by using statistical mechanics and are applied to deduce simple phase diagrams for ideal and regular solutions. The concept of thermodynamic stability is then introduced and illustrated in the context of phase transformations.",

Class discussions will touch on current news events, including the likely historic mid-term election in November. The core class work (and most of your grade) will be based on seven writing assignments due approximately every two weeks throughout the semester. Expect to do some writing each class period. We will learn how to write a story lede (yes, thats how journalists spell it), how to structure a story and how to write different kinds of news stories, from crime news to features to editorials and commentary. We also will learn how to research a news story, conduct an interview and sort through mountains of information to discern whats important so we can write about it in a clear, concise manner.",

Emerging nanomaterials such as fullerenes, graphene, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots and nanocomposites are also discussed. The course then focuses on applications of nanomaterials to microelectronics, particularly nanoscale devices and the emerging field of molecular-scale electronics. The miniaturization of integrated systems that sense mechanical or chemical changes and produce as electrical signal is presented.

The first part of the course addresses why wars occur and what leaders hope to achieve using military power. We will cover the merits and limitations of different explanations for why war occurs and different ethical issues in the use of force, including just war theory and protection of civilians. The second part of the course addresses the sources of warfighting effectiveness, war outcomes, and war termination and will cover a range of material and non-material factors. The final section of the course will cover how recent military, technological, social, and political changes influence what can be achieved through military power and implications for military strategy and doctrine. By the end of the course, students will have general grasp of the major analytic approaches to understanding the occurrence and dynamics of war and will have the tools to think critically about the use of military force.",

In keeping with Albers definition of color theory as a hands-on experiential and experimental process of creating relationships through perception students will work on skills needed to craft compelling images using linear, planar and volumetric assemblies in digital and analog media. Initial weekly exercises will cover principles of color relativity, intensity, temperature, etc., and consider various principles of graphic perception including but not limited to vibrating and vanishing boundaries, figure ground reversals, and the illusion of transparency. Through this process you will gain an understanding of the use of color in the graphic representation of designs, patterns, diagrams and architectural representations that will inform the use of color in transforming the perception of space.

Students should emerge from the class with a better understanding of U.S. grand strategy but also with a greater ability to formulate and communicate their own views on U.S. strategy toward the rest of the world.",

This class will examine the shifting regimes of urban ecology and equip students with skills and core concepts that enable them to lead or contribute to transition through design. As designers we are trained to see patterns--urban ecology asks us also to see processes and to speculate on effects and possible outcomes. This course will discuss the systems and the logics that create the patterns, and we will explore how our design process may be different when dealing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of systems design.

The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace.  It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).  The goal of the project in Mini 1 is to understand the industry dynamics and competitive set, to identify a market based on use of an agile needs-driven innovation methodology (job + job executor + context defines the market), and to segment the market based on identification of jobs to be done by the job executors. These are the drivers for identification of a successful Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a market entry point, and development of a differentiating strategy and self-sustained growth strategy.",

The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.  The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models.  We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions.  These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition.

This course helps current and future product managers understand the distinction between data-driven and conventional products and learn to identify new product capabilities made possible by quantitative data analysis and modeling.   Regular hands-on exercises will expose them to techniques for analyzing data, developing insights,  building models, and turning the outcomes from models into end-user value. The course project will require students to go through the life cycle of a data-product and showcase their insight as a product feature. (Previously Data Analytics). Some class sessions in this course will be offered using a Flipped Classroom model where lectures will be distributed as videos for viewing offline, and class sessions are dedicated to clarifications, content review, and course assignments.

How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations.  The real excitement of data science is in the doing.  This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.  While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained.  If you have not programmed in Python before, you need to be comfortable programming in some language (e.g., Ruby, R, Java, C++) and will need to come up to speed with the Pythonic way of problem solving.",

Developments in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. Students in this course will be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data, including clickstreams, text, speech, and images. This course is for students who are looking for an introduction to applying data science to product management. Backgrounds in basic statistics, and some programming experience are required. Hands-on exercises in Python will illustrate the concepts, but please note this is not a Python class; students who are unfamiliar with Python will be given access to online tutorials to build up their Python skills. In-class exercises and weekly assignments will mainly focus on data science techniques and their application to decision making at various stages of the product life cycle. In the final project, students will select from a variety of data sets to address a product management issue in more depth, from framing the problem through modeling to communicating results.",

Similar engineering and AI/ML problems need to be solved across the entire dynamic range. When developing algorithms or solving RD problems, one usually starts with Matlab and Python using frameworks like Torch, Spark, and TensorFlow, and only resorts to C/C++ when needed. This course covers how to solve AI/ML and engineering research and development problems across the entire range of machines in a productive and performant way. It discusses how to scale problems from the initial concept stage, usually executed on a laptop, to more powerful computing systems like enterprise or HPC servers, GPU-accelerated systems, and cloud computing platforms.  This course addresses a wide range of computational and informatics problem families from traditional numerical simulation and symbolic data processing to AI/ML problems. It covers the most important scalable parallel algorithms used in engineering computing, and discusses frameworks providing problem-specific and general implementation templates. It covers algorithm analysis from the numerical and complexity perspectives, parallelization approaches and scalability, algorithm optimization, evaluation, and analysis of results.   Students in this course learn to productively solve AI/ML and engineering research and development problems on advanced computer systems across the dynamic range of computing systems. Further, they learn to carry algorithms from the concept stage to efficient-enough scaled-up implementations necessary to solve large scale problem instances, or squeeze them into the small footprint of embedded and wearable devices.",

By the end of the course, you will have an improved ability to analyze the information content of financial and managerial accounting statements for decision making. To meet this broad objective, you will develop an analytic framework of how accounting statements inform about the underlying operating, investing, and financing activities, grasp the key accounting concepts that underlie common reporting practices, and understand the way in which accounting measures are sensitive to variations in estimates, methods and possible manipulation. The course divides naturally into three related parts. The first introduces the basic bookkeeping model, including the concepts, definitions, and relationships required for a fundamental understanding of the process that produces the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.  The second part introduces basic concepts of economic and accounting costs and their use in short-term decisions faced by managers.

        "desc": "Real options analysis is an approach to the management of operational assets that exploits managerial flexibility in decision making and strives to combine it with market-driven valuation of cash flows.  This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics.  This course thus includes essential content for students seeking managerial and consulting careers in a wide range of industries and settings.  Applications comprise, but are not limited to, energy, commodities, manufacturing, real estate, pharmaceutical, and high tech enterprises, as well as research and development projects and entrepreneurial endeavors.",

More technically, well be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse. Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kindsincluding politicians, journalists, and scientistsstrategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed. Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends. More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable. Ultimately, you can conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals.",

We will examine some of these debates among peace activists. Advocates for peace have attempted to build movements addressing the factors leading to war. What kinds of efforts have been made for a more peaceful world and how have they fared?  We will examine how world leaders, business people, civil rights, and other peace activists have thought about war and peace. We will examine case studies of select wars and select peace movements.",

We will learn about what separates stars from average performers and how you can become a star, if you so choose. A major premise of the course is that the intellectual capital economy offers unique career opportunities and that gold collar workers (people whose value to the marketplace is their brainpower) need to think in non-traditional ways about how they leverage those opportunities over the course of their careers. As time and class interest permits, the course will include current career topics such as the Great Resignation, remote work, life-work balance, and the effect of technology on thinking, performance, and productivity. This course involves a high degree of personal self-exploration, as well as a mutual sharing of those explorations with your classmates.

        "desc": "In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning, philosophy, and statistics for tackling long-standing causality problems, including how to discover causal knowledge from observational data, known as causal discovery, and how to infer the effect of interventions. A number of researchers have been recognized with the Turing Award (to Pearl in 2012) the Nobel Prize (to Granger in 2003 and to Sims in 2011). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the causal view may facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning or artificial intelligence problems such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, disentanglement, and adversarial vulnerability.   This course is concerned with understanding causality, learning causality from observational data, and using causality to tackle a class of learning problems. We will particularly focus on two key problems in causality. One is causal discovery. It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make this statement more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal influences may take place between the underlying hidden variables, and what we measure may be their reflections; so we will also see how to find the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations by analyzing measured variables. Its implication in unsupervised deep learning will be discussed. The other is how to properly make use of causal information. This includes identification of causal effects, counterfactual reasoning, improving machine learning in light of causal knowledge, and forecasting in complex environments, and we will investigate how the causal perspective helps in domain adaptation, image-to-image translation, and deep reinforcement learning.",

Within less than two decades, this consensus began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered. By 1550, Europe was splintered into various conflicting churches, confessions, sects, and factions, each with its own set of truths and its own plan for reforming the church and society at large. This period of rapid and unprecedented change in western history is commonly known as the Reformation. Though this term has traditionally referred to the birth of Protestantism, it also encompasses the simultaneous renewal and reform that occurred within Roman Catholicism.    This course will survey the Reformations of the sixteenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, examining the causes of the Reformation, the dynamics of reform, and its significance for western society and culture.  In the process, we will analyze such on-going  problems as religious persecution and the accommodation of dissent, the relationship between religion and politics, and the interactions between ideology and political, social, and economic factors in the process of historical change.",

This requires not only advanced analysis support through data inferencing to reveal the real-world problems, but also mapping techniques to showcase the story to stakeholders. In this course, students will collect local or global data and apply mapping skills, including using ArcGIS and Illustrator, to map local experience and large-scale urban systems, and use spatial data science to make inferences. Potential advanced ArcGIS skills will be introduced, such as raster imagery analysis, and/or using Python (in ArcGIS Notebook) for machine learning, to identify urban built environment issues, including urban heat island, flooding risks, and social inequity; and provide evidenced-based mapping interface for decision making. In addition, parametric urban design using Ladybug 3D analysis will be introduced for outdoor design optimization. There will be both lectures and labs with hands on exercises to learn from case studies and to prepare students for their final projects on topics of their own interests. Students are required to take the intro ArcGIS course before taking this advanced level media course. Basic mapping skills with ESRI ArcGIS Pro and online Dashboard design skills are required.",

Enrollment is limited to 45 students.The course will be of interest to the student interested in an entrepreneurial career, and who wants to expand his/her understanding of finance as it relates to a small company in its early stages of growth. The course will also be useful for the student interested in venture capital or other forms of high-risk investing. The course intends to build on the concepts introduced in the Entrepreneurship courses 45805 and 45806.  The course will extend the concepts to emphasize the financial aspects of entrepreneurship, and particularly the strategy for successfully raising money. The course will be a combination of readings, lectures and case analyses that emphasize each area, with appropriate class visitors.    Upon the completion of the course, the student will understand the complexities and nuances involved in creating successful investment transactions for the company, investors and founders. The student will learn to appreciate the art of the deal and how deals get done in the real world.    The course will begin with an analysis of risk in the entrepreneurial setting, and then will proceed to look at the structure of the venture capital industry. It is important to understand the process and context in which equity investors make decisions and how an entrepreneur can favorably affect that decision process. Throughout the course there will be exposure to the private investor and how capital from that source compares to institutional venture capital.    The course will then look at the due diligence process that both the investor and entrepreneur go through, with the use of a real life case that allows the student",

Gameplay is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. In class we utilize two existing Intellectual Properties (The Lord of the Rings and Thedas, the world of EAs DragonAge role playing games). Students who desire admittance to this class must be intimately familiar with at least one of those two worlds to gain entry. We just do not have time to review those works once class starts. Each writer works on a team to create an original RPG campaign-style adventure for that game and story world. The final product is a portfolio-quality set of dramatic scenes, epic tabletop encounters, and character sketches. This is not an RPG design course, nor will how RPGs work will not be taught.  Any level of writing experience is welcome, BUT experience playing RPGs -- either tabletop or video game -- is a must. Experience as a GM for an RPG is a big plus, and applicants who possess such experience should be sure to let the instructor know in advance.",

In 1957, Chomsky published Syntactic Structures, building on earlier research but at the same time providing a novel approach to age-old problems in linguistics, particularly the productivity problem and the learning problem. (How do speakers produce and understand novel sentences, and how do children learn without being taught?) While it is true that the field has progressed far since 1957, Syntactic Structures still stands out for its simplicity and usefulness. In this course we look at how more recent developments in syntax can be reconciled with this earlier approach.

Within the context of this class project and exploration of alternative fabrication and construction , students may design and create a costume that is a wild interpretation of a timeless theme, a costume that is authentic and true to the period, a conflicted and contradictory costume inspiring a deeper view, or a subtle costume that investigates the real lives of the people depicted in this painting. Students are commended to employ a great deal of freedom to interpret and bring to life selected artwork a through the lens of costume design.

Environmental harms, underpinned by the ongoing legacies of industrial production, extraction, and segregative planning, create a toxic combination adversely impacting human health, ecology, and community futures. These challenges necessitate multidisciplinary, collaborative, and emancipatory approaches to knowing the built environment, and community-centered methods in urban design that attend to the local histories, embodied knowledges, and political ecologies of life in toxic systems. This studio will expand on MUD students understanding of neighborhood-scaled urban design through the examination of urban systems and systemic processes, focusing on the infrastructures of toxicity, and modes of local action against them. It will be anchored in an ongoing collaboration with North Braddock Residents For Our Future, a grassroots organization which has led the opposition to unconventional gas drilling and environmental injustice in Braddock and North Braddock and surrounding communities.",

On the basis of the discussions and exercises in class, students gather and analyze relevant Japanese data for their project, which facilitates their understanding of the grammar points and cultural ways of thinking in question, and develops their analytical skills. This course is taught in Japanese. A student with prior experience in Japanese must take the placement exam.",

This method is used to isolate patterns of behavioral and communication usage and change, as revealed through the study of the world-wide web and large computerized databases such as CHILDES, TalkBank, or the British National Corpus.  Tools here include text searches and data-mining.      Conversation Analysis. This is a microanalytic method used to examine sequencing, repair, and orientation in closely transcribed recordings of spoken interactions, as made available through systems such as the CABank database, as well as recorded programs on YouTube and elsewhere.      Coding Systems.  This approach seeks to capture interactional and behavioral structures in writing, teaching, interview, and other interactions.  Here, there will be a special emphasis on the coding of instructional interactions.      Gesture Analysis.  This microanalytic method seeks to track patterns in gestural and nonverbal communication, often in association with spoken messages.      Profile Analysis. This approach studies differences across learners at various ages and ability levels and group differences involving aphasia, autism, stuttering, dementia, and other individual differences.    Students will work with data already available from previous studies, and will also learn to collect their own new datasets.

The measurement of neural activity involves a number of basic tools that have evolved over decades to sense the activity of neurons (individual neurons, populations of neurons and nerve fibers) or activity that is related to neurons (such as the oxygenation of blood in the brain). To intervene in the nervous system, a comparable set of tools have evolved to change neural activity locally or globally, on short and long time scales. The successful application of these methods to measure and manipulate neural activity requires both a basic science and engineering understanding of the principles behind their action, along with practical experience in applying them in real-world settings. This laboratory course will pair lectures with laboratory exercises to gain a deep understanding of the tools we use to measure and manipulate neural activity, as well as the analytic approaches to this data. It will involve both building and diagnosing recording hardware, experimental data collection, data analysis in Matlab or Python, and scientific writing.

From a small group of sound researchers making field recordings in natural landscapes and urban areas has grown the modern study of Acoustic Ecology on a global scale, and also the creative practice of Soundscape Composition, in which recorded elements of sound environments are expressively explored through electronic music. Beginning with a history of the WSP, this course surveys aspects of the field of Acoustic Ecology as an aesthetic, political, and ethical phenomenon, with special attention to its relationship with the creative and sound practices of Soundwalking, Deep Listening, and Soundscape Composition. This course will also contextualize the WSP within a broader history of music and sound in the background, including Saties Furniture Music, Muzak, and coffee shop music.  Throughout the course, students will participate in the activity and design of soundwalking, sonic field documentation / recording and sonic-environmental sampling, and the performance of background music. The course will culminate in a soundscape project entailing the composition of a Soundscape work, or the presentation of a creative mapping of aspects of their own sound environments; special guests will provide students with instruction in sound capture and manipulation.",

Corporations are increasingly dealing with more viable competitors and emerging market opportunities, often driven by enabling technologies, from all over the world. Demand for government responses to social issues is increasing in an era of acute resource constraints. And social sector organizations are facing a wide array of competitors for smaller, more restricted pools of contributions and other forms of capital. Everybody wants to react faster, take advantage of opportunities sooner, and vanquish competitors more definitively. The notion of rigid 5-year strategic plans is becoming obsolete. This course simulates the real-world strategy development process from a senior management perspective. A historical overview of the field will be provided and a contemporary process for strategy formulation, along with alternative approaches, will be introduced and demonstrated throughout the course. Activities including situational and environmental analysis, internal capabilities assessment, and appropriate linkage to an organizations vision, mission, objectives, and historical performance will all be rigorously applied. A combination of theory and practice in all relevant aspects of strategy development will be emphasized. In addition, although these processes are most often attributed to private sector operations, this course is designed to consider the similarities and differences of strategy and strategy development in government entities and nonprofits as well.

What impact will the shocks generated by the COVID crisis  rising inflation have on employment  income inequality in the short run  the long run?  What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive  equitable? The curriculum has been rewritten to help Heinz students ( other interested CMU students) think seriously  rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the US labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quant. analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the US labor market for decades,  that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws,  discrimination based on race  gender have contributed to rising inequality in US incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old  new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive,  it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference.

Social scientists have found much material in the region to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the regions present, it is necessary to study path dependence. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on the Cold War (1947-1991) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last forty years, including the wave of transitions to democracy to the current challenges to democratic consolidation.

Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and devil worship dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the most intense campaign of witch-hunting in all of Europes history. Before it was over, the Great European Witch-Hunt of the early modern era cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its colonies. And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators. This course examines witchcraft beliefs and witch-hunting in historical perspective in both their European and colonial contexts.  In addition to the early modern witch-hunts, it will address modern witchcraft beliefs and consider witch-hunting as a global problem today.  It will focus on the origin and rationale of witch beliefs, the factors driving the timing and intensity of witch-hunts, and the patterns of accusations.  Throughout, we will examine the many historical and regional variations in witch beliefs and prosecutions and explore how they reflect major social and cultural issues such as the relationship between popular and elite culture; religious change; state formation; gender and patriarchy; and the rationalization of law, medicine, and science.  This course satisfies one of the elective requirements for the Religious Studies minor.",

This course is designed to give PhD students a thorough grounding in the methods, mathematics and algorithms needed to do research and applications in machine learning. Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that anyone with a strong numerate background can catch up and fully participate. You can evaluate your ability to take the course via a self-assessment exam that will be made available to you  after you register.  If you are interested in this topic, but are not a PhD student, or are a PhD student not specializing in machine learning, you might consider the masters level course on Machine Learning, 10-601.  This class may be appropriate for MS and undergrad students who are interested in the theory and algorithms behind ML. If you are unsure whether you have sufficient mathematical background to do well in this course, you should consider taking the minis 10-606/10-607 Mathematical Background for Machine Learning. You can find a link to the Intro to ML course comparison page, which includes a self-assessment exam to help you choose which Intro to ML course to take, in the Course URL field.",

Of particular interest is the question, why have efforts to resolve the conflict so often failed? What modifications to past approaches might prove successful?

Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera, by combining imaging and computation to enable new and enhanced ways of capturing, representing, and interacting with the physical world.  This advanced undergraduate course provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in computational photography. At the start of the course, we will study modern image processing pipelines, including those encountered on mobile phone and DSLR cameras, and advanced image and video editing algorithms. Then we will proceed to learn about the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as 3D scanning, coded photography, lightfield imaging, time-of-flight imaging, VR/AR displays, and computational light transport. Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue.  The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them. For their final projects, students will have the choice to use modern sensors provided by the instructors (lightfield cameras, time-of-flight cameras, depth sensors, structured light systems, etc.).  This course requires familarity with linear algebra, calculus, programming, and doing computations with images.  The course does not require prior experience with photography or imaging.",

Since Darwins theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.",

His notions of indifference, (critique of aesthetic judgment), reproducibility, simulation, performativity, artist-as-curator, and interactivity between the spectator and the work of art set the stage for a host of innovative explorations by artists ranging from the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg to the Mod-Spaceships of Mariko Mori. This seminar examines a tumultuous period in contemporary art and culture from 1960 to the mid-eighties, with special excursions into the aesthetics of commodification, phenomenology, materialism, conceptualism, semiotics, abjection, and technology.

This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the lambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. We shall see how this idea connects logic with topology (the models of a theory form a space).

Mathematical optimization techniques have been applied for decades in the context of logistics, supply chain management, and strategic planning, with great success. In this course, the most important methods and techniques underlying mathematical optimization are studied. These include linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming as basic mathematical methodologies. Based on these, we also consider methodologies for particular problem classes such as network models and traveling salesman problems. During the course we will emphasize mathematical modeling, that is, creating a mathematical description that reflects a given practical problem described in words. Motivated by these mathematical models, we then discuss the necessary mathematical techniques for finding optimal solutions. Lastly, we consider the solution of these problems using optimization software, i.e., we represent the mathematical models in Excel and use Excel Solver to compute an optimal solution.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.  This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics.  Throughout, this course illustrates qualitative as well as quantitative principles and business analytics applied to real SCM challenges  the tools of SCM  with an emphasis on approaches to increase responsiveness to manage risk.",

For each circuit introduced, we will develop techniques and present theory for evaluating their functionality and speed. Other methods will be described for analyzing a circuits power consumption, testability, silicon area requirements, correctness, and cost. In addition, we will utilize various CAD tools to evaluate the circuits described. Finally, advanced timing and clocking concepts will be investigated. For example, the notion of clock skew will be introduced and its impact on clock period for sequential circuits will be analyzed. We will also learn how to analyze and design asynchronous circuits, a class of sequential circuits that do not utilize a clock signal.

Furthermore, we highlight various respects in which language and linguistics intersects with societal issues.

This includes electric power plants (renewable and non-renewable); transmission and distribution; and consumers. Then, electric power is addressed from a mathematical point of view. The mathematical formulae for AC power and models for the above mentioned elements are derived which will enable you to calculate how much power is flowing over which lines on its way from the power plant to the consumer. Maintaining the balance between generation and consumption is important to avoid catastrophic blackout events. Hence, the notion of stability and available control concepts will be introduced.",

The focus is on designing and pricing derivative securities to trade on and hedge customized risk exposures - particularly those involving non-linear, path-dependent, and/or multi-variable exposures to interest rates, equity prices, credit events, and commodity prices, - pitching these exotic securities to clients, and managing any associated risks. The valuation frameworks used to price these derivatives are Risk Neutral Valuation and Monte Carlo Simulation. Specific models include local volatility and stochastic volatility equity option pricing models, Hull-White style interest rate models, HJM term structure model, and statistical credit risk models. The course also highlights practical issues about model calibration, model risk, and static and dynamic hedging. The highlight of the course is a series of in-class team case presentations. While pricing and hedging techniques are important, so too are practical issues such as deciding which risks to share contractually and knowing how to pitch a derivative deal. The in-class presentations are a chance to practice standing in front of a client or boss and sell/explain complicated financial products.",

A series of activities will be used to help the students understand how messages flow among people.  As we live in a digital world, people use many different platforms to communication. The instantaneous and far-reaching communication nature impacts our relationships and business. The second part of the class will talk about written communication in a professional setting. Meanwhile we will address communication which happens in feedback and conflicts.   Finally, as we are facing a global and diverse society, how do we work under a multilingual environment? The language differences dont just exist in between different countries. They are also everywhere among different groups and departments. For example, in theatre, technicians speak an entirely different language than performers. In a theatre company, you will find departments like finance, marketing, human resources have their distinctive vocabularies. Students will learn how to communicate with awareness and respects under these perspectives.",

In this course, we will explore the complicated role of chemistry in this epidemic, including the good (elucidating mechanisms of action, development of clinically useful and safe opiates and non-opiate pain killers) and the bad (design and synthesis of increasingly addictive opiates). We will also discuss ethical questions faced by the pharmaceutical industry that develops, markets and sells opiates, the medical community that prescribes opiates, and the government agencies charged with regulating these activities.

This field is called Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics, and it is extremely multidisciplinary. This course will therefore include some ideas central to Machine Learning and to Linguistics.  Well cover computational treatments of words, sounds, sentences, meanings, and conversations. Well see how probabilities and real-world text data can help. Well see how different levels interact in state-of-the-art approaches to applications like translation and information extraction.  From a software engineering perspective, there will be an emphasis on rapid prototyping, a useful skill in many other areas of Computer Science.",

As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking.

To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. In class we utilize two existing Intellectual Properties (The Lord of the Rings and Thedas, the world of EAs DragonAge role playing games). Students who desire admittance to this class must be intimately familiar with at least one of those two worlds to gain entry. We just do not have time to review those works once class starts.

This course attempts to bridge the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship.  We introduce you to an essential skill of market discovery or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where?  Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies role-playing and solving actual problems of local tech businesses.       The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, which is why this course will use true-to-life scenarios as the anchor for the course. The class will be divided into 4 teams will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local) or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor or both.",

This will help us put a critical lens on land, environmental and ecological art, ecoventions, architectural living systems, biomimicry, biophilia, and projective ecologies while we consider the influence of gardens, responsive landscapes, hyper-natures, and artificial ecologies in changing the way we design and build. We look for not only relevance but joy and beauty in practices that highlight the relation between desire, responsibility, more-than-human wellbeing, and ecological justice. This may help us build notions of care and stewardship and an understanding traditional and emergent cultural constructs that can define an eco-centric practice which shapes building futures.

The various types of atomic bonding, e.g., Van der Waals, metallic, ionic, covalent and hydrogen are surveyed. Binding energies of some crystalline structures are calculated. Models of crystal binding are generalized to include dynamics, first for classical lattice vibrations and then for quantized lattice vibrations known as phonons. These concepts are used to calculate the heat capacities of insulating crystals, to introduce the concept of density of states, and to discuss phonon scattering. The band theory of solids is developed, starting with the free electron model of a metal and culminating with the properties of conductors and semiconductors. Magnetic phenomena such as paramagnetism and the mean field theory of ferromagnetism are covered to the extent that time permits.",

We are constantly evaluating and interpreting data from our environment, in everything from spreadsheets to Instagram posts. At the same time, our own personal data are being observed and recorded--through websites we visit online, our smart devices, and even our interactions with other students and faculty at CMU. Navigating this data universe requires knowledge of what data is and how to use it responsibly. For example, can a plant be a data set? Discovering the truth behind a piece of data, including who made it, what it looks like, and what we can learn from it, is a critical skill. Understanding data can be the difference between being able to distinguish truth from lies; and the key to identifying your data footprint and succeeding in research and in your career. In this course, we will explore the data universe from multiple angles and across several types of data. We will define, find, and analyze data, and most importantly, identify narratives within data to tell stories about the world around us. We will examine data using the following questions",

Student teams learn about the Department of Defense/Homeland Security as an organization, its culture, and its mission to instill a culture of relentless resilience across the United States.  Teams learn to apply Lean Innovation frameworks and tools to identify key stakeholders, understand their needs, and develop and test iterative minimum viable products (MVPs), leading to a solution. Using a flipped-classroom approach, the teams brief the teaching team on their progress each week and receive direct coaching from their instructors, mentors, and subject matter experts from across the DoD/DHS and entrepreneurship ecosystems. Problem sets focus on solving problems in specific agencies including the armed forces (Navy, Army, USAF, Marines, etc.) and branches of DHS including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), etc.",

This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The Tibet Question is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between China and Tibet from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the Tibet Question have constructed historical narratives (propaganda) in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the Tibet Question may hold for understanding other outstanding historical disputes.",

Early Mobile Home design presented an opportunity to develop new housing typologies viewed as cutting-edge and innovative; marketed as both a modern  affordable means of living. Since the post-war period, Mobile Homes and their occupants have been relegated to the periphery of American society. Housing stock is aging, and new homes have failed to adapt to contemporary modes of living. The Mobile Home presents an affordable housing typology that is widely ignored by Architects despite a growing demand for small, affordable and efficient housing.  The first half of the semester will focus on the design of a new Mobile Housing Prototype. During the second half of the semester, students will refine their prototypes while adopting a specific region of the US in which to adapt their designs. Throughout multiple cycles of research and design, we will use physical models and orthographic drawings as our primary means of investigation and representation.

How good are we at estimating the accuracy of our memories of the past? How about what we will remember or forget in the future? Can we use such knowledge to do better?  The study of metacognition provides an answer to these and many more questions. In other words,  metacognition is the path to better knowing yourself.",

The transport of chemicals through the environment and their partitioning between air, water, soil, and people will be described. The major environmental reaction pathways (oxidation, photolysis, hydrolysis, reduction, metabolism) of common pollutants will be explored. This will provide students with the necessary knowledge to predict the chemical fate of environmental pollutants, and improve their understanding of the environmental impacts of their everyday chemical use and exposure. Specific topics include water quality, photochemical smog, organic aerosols, atmospheric chemistry and global climate change, toxicity of pesticides, and heterogeneous and multiphase atmospheric chemistry.

Owing its rising popularity to the ease and accessibility of production and distribution, there has never been a better time to create and tell stories in audio. In this course students will take on the role of podcast producers, learning while creating a series of podcasts that explore linguistic and cultural landscapes with the goals of educating and entertaining. Possible audio resources include field interviews with native speakers in their own language, allowing student producers to document informants personal histories and aspects of their life related to culture, multilingualism, or political, social or environmental issues. Students will blend studio recordings with interviews and/or suitable found recordings, music, and sound. Coursework will include skill development on audio recording and podcasting, production management, creative thinking, materials sourcing, and giving and receiving constructive feedback from classmates and varied audiences on team and individual projects.

This course will first deeply explore the history of economic statecraft and concepts underpinning the strategic calculations regarding its use. It will scrutinize the most evocative form of policy - economic sanctions - in addition to broader frameworks of statecraft which utilize multilateral forums which are the carrots of international economic policy. It will also educate students on the state of the literature regarding sanctions efficacy, and understanding what features of the economy render target states most vulnerable to coercion. In this way we will contextualize claims that Russia sanction-proofed its economy prior to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and gain deeper insight into the unprecedented sanctions which have been imposed as a result. The course will also discuss the Iranian case, assess Chinese economic statecraft, and conjecture about how economic statecraft fits within the broader context of an emerging US-China rivalry.",

We will cover a variety of front-end programming contexts, including conventional graphical user interface (GUI) programming for mobile apps (phones, watches), web apps, and regular desktop applications, across a variety of frameworks. We will also cover programming for data-driven and conversational (AI) user interfaces. We will briefly touch on front-end programming for visualizations, games, 3D, and virtual and artificial reality (VR and AR), along with interactive UI tools such as prototypers and resource editors. The homeworks and project in this course will involve extensive object-oriented programming, likely in both Java and JavaScript, so this course is only appropriate for students with a strong programming background.

Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was developed and popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.",

Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.

Students will learn to apply refactoring for different granularity levels in a software system and additional resources such as APIs, databases, and test code. By the end of the course, students are expected to (i) recognize symptoms in the source code that warrant refactoring; (ii) apply refactoring at the architectural level and code level; (iii) evaluate the impact of the applied refactoring operations, (iv) design, implement, and deploy a tool to support software refactoring.

The string quartet repertoire under discussion spans the first attempts at string quartet writing in the 17th Century, to serialism and microtonal disintegration in the 1960s, to contemporary Pop-Rock fusion experiments.  This course also deals with the social and personal histories of four individuals who freed themselves from hegemonic orchestral rules in favor of an instrumental democratic microcosm.",

While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1) critiqued the discipline of rhetoric; 2) developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts; and 3) expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include (but are not limited to) canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics (Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster), influential theories on contemporary topics (Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome), and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists (Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai). Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric. Undergraduates students (both majors and non-majors) will have the opportunity to examine how gender intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives.

The position taken in this course is that understanding American philosophical ideas about authority, power, and freedom is as central to demystifying the U.S. form of democracy as is understanding how decision-making institutions function. Thus, on one side, this course looks at how American political thought is infused into political institutions and society. On the other side, it investigates institutional arrangements using rationalistic theories. In addition, scientific writings at the intersection of psychology and economics are used to probe the possibility of gaining explanatory leverage on U.S. politics from the perspective of behavioral decision-making theories.",

However powerful and durable that image is, the history of house and home in America is actually a far more complex story with many different twists and turns. In the course we will look at both urban and suburban housing choices and cultures, ranging from single family detached dwellings to multi-unit housing, and across a social spectrum income, class, race, and gender. Through the use of occasional field trips, we will use Pittsburgh as a touchstone for understanding broader national trends in the history of American urban and suburban housing. The course is organized as a lecture course supplemented with field trips and discussions based on field trips and primary source readings.  The additional time slot on Thursday afternoons will be used only when field trips are scheduled.

This economic growth transformed the patterns of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the East Asian miracle.  The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other miracle economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade.  These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian growth model that had been hidden during the boom years.  Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the worlds most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries.  However, new worries about Chinese economic growth have emerged in recent years.  Is Chinas growth miracle slowing down?  How does the economic history of Asias more advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and China?  In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic development than that taken by their predecessors?  The United States has long played an important role in Asia as an investor, customer, and key ally of important nations in the region.  How will the policies of the new Biden Administration shape these important relationships and the future evolution of the region?  We will seek to address all of these questions.",

The course will have a methodological component largely centered on using experiments to evaluate interventions and policies that apply to households, small firms, and farms. While we will cover standard economic approaches, we will give extra attention to how a behavioral lens can help in both understanding development issues (e.g. barriers to household risk management) and in designing effective interventions (e.g. the timing of fertilizer sales).",

After decades of slow wage growth  rising inequality, many American workers now fear an epidemic of joblessness as new technologies increasingly replace human labor. Is this likely to occur? How will emerging technologies reshape the US labor market? How important is the gig economy,  how big might it become? What impact will the shocks generated by the COVID crisis  rising inflation have on employment  income inequality in the short run  the long run?  What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive  equitable? The curriculum has been rewritten to help students think seriously  rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the US labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quant analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the US labor market for decades,  that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws,  discrimination based on race  gender have contributed to rising inequality in US incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old  new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive,  it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference.

In lab, you will learn how to design and program effective graphical user interfaces, and how to perform user tests. We will cover a number of prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews of student work. This course is for HCII Masters students and HCI dual majors with a minimal programming background. Students will often not be professional programmers, but will need to interact with programmers.

On the theoretical side, the course will overview recent economic theories of technological change that analyze the changing nature of work and the changing demands for workers abilities. To gain an in-depth understanding of technology and to decompose the impacts on workers, the course will also look at engineering models of production. The class will focus on a wide range of technologies both historical and modern, ranging from early forms of automation to advanced robotics, additive manufacturing and AI. On the quantitative side, the course will provide students with hands-on opportunities for analyzing data. For example, students will use both data on technological adoption  and worker-level data to learn broad lessons on the impact of technology both in the US as well as in other advanced economies. The class will conclude by looking at the set of policies available to governments aimed at easing the transition of technologically-displaced workers. Examples will include universal basic income and retraining programs.",

BCIs have emerged as a novel technology that bridges the brain with external devices. BCIs have been developed to decode human intention, leading to direct brain control of a computer or device, bypassing the neuromuscular pathway. Bi-directional brain-computer interfaces not only allows device control, but also opens the door for modulating the central nervous system through neural interfacing. Using various recorded brain signals that reflect the intention of the brain, BCI systems have shown the capability to control external devices, such as computers and robots. Neural stimulation using electrical, magnetic, optical and acoustic energy has shown capability to better understanding of the brain functions and intervene with central nervous systems. This course teaches the fundamentals how a BCI system works and various building blocks of BCIs, from signal acquisition, signal processing, feature extraction, feature translation, neurostimulation, to device control, and various applications. Examples of noninvasive BCIs are discussed to provide an in-depth understanding of the noninvasive BCI technology.

The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

Some have also coined this time as the second renaissance noting that this era is changing our core frameworks for civilization. As in the age of the renaissance, creativity and the arts are often at the cutting edge for creating and incorporating technologies in the world even though some nonprofit institutions seem slow to adapt. This seminar course provides students with multiple perspectives on how emerging technologies are disrupting arts enterprises, including arts-making, audience engagement, and arts management. From the Internet of Things to Virtual Reality, students will investigate what is happening in the field and whats on the fringe and about to break into the marketplace. Through readings, hands-on activities, and individualized research the course provides a breadth of understanding of multiple technologies for students overall while each individual student pursues deeper expertise in one or two technologies of their choice. The material submitted for assignments may be recommended to be included in the content created for AMT Lab (www.amt-lab.org) Readers for the platform are arts management professionals working in the field. Approximately 3000 individuals from around the world read the content monthly. The process for publication is provided on Canvas.",

This course will examine these and related questions through the lens of legal cases in which individuals or institutions are accused of responsibility for harm, from vehicular accident cases to criminal trials. The study of these questions is not only valuable for understanding the legal process, participating in it, or writing about it, but the practice of attributing responsibility is common in many social and institutional contexts beyond law, even in daily conversation. The course explores fundamental questions about culture, ethics, and politics, including issues involving systematic and structural inequalities involving race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and national origin, which are evident both in the legal cases studied and in the public imagination and controversy beyond the courtroom. The societal implications explored include inequitable constraints on freedom in criminal justice and economic inequalities perpetuated through civil lawsuits, as well as inequalities in cultural power and status in the ways some voices are recognized in the legal process and others are not. Drawing on readings from rhetoric, linguistics, and legal studies, as well as briefs, opening and closing arguments, direct and cross-examinations of witnesses, physical and documentary evidence, and judicial opinions from legal cases, we will examine the strategies advocates use to attribute responsibility, enhance equity, and manage such disputes.",

By the end of the course, apart from acquiring hands-on experience in realizing the synergy between large scale data, creative research questions and effective NLP solutions, we all hope to have an improved understanding of why we are in what we are in. The course will provide some useful data sets and a list of potential project ideas for its primary focus -- the semester-long project. Students will work in small teams (1-2 members) on course projects. The course engineer will provide useful scripts and code to efficiently process data. The course requires familiarity with machine learning at a level of being able to complete a substantial project. Students without the necessary prerequisites should contact the instructor for special permission.",

Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was developed and popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.",

In the current political environment, leaders on both the American political left (like Senator Bernie Sanders) and the political right (like Donald Trump), have called into question this bipartisan consensus in favor of freer trade and investment. That turn away from globalization has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Was the earlier pro-globalization consensus wrong? Is globalization good or bad for the U.S. economy? What are the impacts of globalization on the rest of the world? How has economic globalization impacted the environment and income inequality in the U.S. and around the world? How should the Biden Administration seek to manage international economic policy? This course provides future policy makers and managers with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to understand economic globalization and its effects. These issues will be studied using the analytical tools and concepts of international economics. Guest lectures and case studies will provide a range of perspectives on current policy debates. The course will also examine science-based policies that could maximize the benefits and minimize the disruption generated by globalization. The fall 2021 version of the course will examine the global macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which international policy coordination -- or lack thereof -- worsened that impact.",

Students also survey a broad range of IR theories, including grand paradigms from realism to constructivism, mainstream mid-level theories that help explain global politics and aid in foreign policy analysis, as well as critical, feminist, and non-western IR theory. The second half of the course introduces students to the two major sub-fields of IR, namely security studies (concerned with the causes of war and peace, the politics of alliances, etc.) and international political economy (concerned with the causes of protectionism and free trade, the politics of economic tools of statecraft such as foreign aid, sanctions, etc.). The course ends by considering contemporary challenges posed by armed non-state actors, climate change, and various threats to the post-World War II liberal international order. This course should help students to better understand the world we live in and equip students with tools for analyzing various international events and foreign policy challenges.",

We will cover topics such as Americas perennial battles between isolationism and internationalism, the creation of the US-led world order after 1945, the containment of communism, and anti-terrorism after 9/11. We will cover enduring and global issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, humanitarian intervention, and international economic policy, as well. Further, a main focus of the course is how foreign policy is made - the role each branch of government plays in foreign policy making, the impact of domestic politics and public opinion, and how other countries receive and react to American foreign policy. The course will use both history and data analysis to understand how foreign policy works, how it is made, and its effect both at home and abroad. A good grasp of the 20th century American and world history, and some familiarity with international relations theory are not requirements but will prove helpful. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired a broad understanding of the most important foreign policy events of the last century and have the tools to analyze foreign policy decision-making.",

        "desc": "Historically, the performance and efficiency of computers has scaled favorably (according to Moores Law) with improvements at the transistor level that followed a steady trend (so-called Dennard scaling). Unfortunately, device scaling has hit a limit   on performance and power improvements dictated by physical device properties. To continue to make systems capable, fast, energy efficient, programmable, and reliable in this post-Dennard era, computer architects must be creative and innovate across the layers of the system stack.  This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts.  We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moores Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated.  The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance.  The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures.  Topics will include reconfigurable architectures, FPGAs in the datacenter, ASIC accelerators, GPGPU architectures, and the changes to the system stack that these components demand. The third trend is the emergence of newly capable hardware and software systems and new models of computation.  Topics will include approximate and neuromorphic computing, intermittent computing, emerging non-volatile memory and logic technologies, and analog and asynchronous architectures, and may include future emerging topics.",

Overall, designers must have skills to collaborate in cross-disciplinary teams. An encompassing framework for these disparate disciplines and domains of 21st-century design is the transdisciplinarity (or antidisciplinarity) of Cybernetics.   Cybernetics can be understood as the study of systems with purpose, whether machines or living things, including their unpredictable interactions. Central to Cybernetics is conversation as a mechanism of design, inclusivity, participation, innovation, and the impetus to action.

In our daily life and science, people often attempt to answer such causal questions for the purpose of understanding, proper manipulation of systems, and robust prediction under interventions. In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning, philosophy, statistics, and economics for tackling long-standing causality problems, and a number of researchers have been recognized with the Turing Award (to Pearl in 2012) the Nobel Prize (to Granger in 2003 and to Sims in 2011). This course is primarily concerned with historical and technical developments of modern causality research, focusing particularly on how to discover causality from observational data and how to infer the causal effect of one variable on another. Thinking more broadly, causal analysis is a particular branch of unsupervised multivariate analysis. Accordingly, this course also provides a big picture of the foundations of causation and unsupervised machine learning. We start with unsupervised learning and multivariate statistical analysis problems including factor analysis, principal component analysis, and independent component analysis, and formulate their assumptions, develop their solutions, and study their connections with causal analysis. Finally, we investigate how the causal perspective helps in solving advanced machine learning or artificial intelligence problems, including transfer learning, image-to-image translation, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised deep learning.",

This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. Beginning with several works about regional/Islamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion. With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements. Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage. For each of these controversies, we will be reading a range of positions represented in different types of writing across genre, including scholarly writing, legal cases, media debates, films and literature.",

This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems, though we will discuss some recent advances in nonconvex optimization. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken 10-701 or an equivalent machine learning or statistical modeling class is strongly encouraged, as we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class. Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester.",

We will cover data collection, signal processing, data processing, data visualization, feature engineering, machine learning tools, and some prototyping technologies. The course will focus on class discussions, hands-on demonstrations, and tutorials. Students will be evaluated on their class participation, multiple mini projects, and a final team project.",

We will investigate the theoretical underpinnings of representation from a democratic norms perspective, the legal and constitutional nature of U.S. institutions, and evaluate empirically how well represented the public is. The class will have a central theme of how race and racial attitudes affect representation. Voting rights, the Voting Rights Act, and subsequent court cases will be highlighted.  In the United States, legislative elections are held in single-member districts, which require the drawing of district boundaries every decade. Several weeks of the course will be devoted to understanding this process. The course will culminate with a final project in which we will draw electoral maps that could act as alternatives or remedies to maps enacted this decade.",

These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey.  Why people are willing to drive across town to save 5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save 5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class.  In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the third-party course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the third-party course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the Universitys cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from 13 to 75.",

Todays communication professionals are crucial to their arts organizations; they maintain existing audiences, secure new audiences, create future donors, and create the brand for the institution.  They interact with all aspects of the organization, from personnel to fundraising.   This course provides readings and professional presentations to guide the understanding of successful marketing and communication, while following a project-based method to allow students to investigate hands-on the opportunities addressing the changes within the arts audience and the shifting digital landscape for marketing the arts in the United States. The focus of the course is marketing and communications within a nonprofit arts organization, while recognizing that the audience doesnt typically distinguish the difference; yet, due to budget and purpose, marketing not-for-profit arts organizations is significantly different as compared to a for-profit entertainment venture. This course will provide each student with marketing principles and theories as well as opportunities to actualize theories with assignments and a final project utilizing current technologies.   The course requires active, practical engagement and intellectual rigor.",

How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as unstructured. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach. We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series.
