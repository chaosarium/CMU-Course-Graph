> Enlighten your path.

This repo presents the current state of team C.H.I.L.L Technology's TartanHacks 2023 Project. It's a graph-based course selection for CMU that visualises the dependencies between courses. The tool also lets you save courses you have taken, courses you wish to explore or take and see them on the graph.
